# 2024 Six Nations Championship

The 2024 Six Nations Championship (known as the Guinness Men's Six Nations for sponsorship reasons) was a rugby union competition that took place in February and March 2024, and featured the men's national teams of England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. It was the 130th season of the competition (including its incarnations as the Home Nations Championship and the Five Nations Championship), but the 25th since it expanded to become the Six Nations Championship in 2000. It started on 2 February 2024 with a Friday night match between France and Ireland, and concluded with France against England on 16 March. France played their home fixtures away from their normal venue, the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, as the stadium was being prepared for use in the 2024 Summer Olympics later in the year.

Ireland entered the competition as reigning champions, having won the Grand Slam for the fourth time in 2023. They retained the championship – the third time they had won back-to-back championships, having done so previously in 1949 and 2015 – but did not secure a second successive Grand Slam.

## Player of the tournament
Tempted to say Antoine Dupont, whose stock rose even higher in his absence. Or Tommy Reffell, a rare shaft of light for Wales. But Ireland won the title again and James Lowe is among the green machine’s most vital cogs. He contributed four tries, two of them in defeat to England, and his roving instincts and long kicking game add even more value.

Michele Lamaro. There were showier players, speedier players, stronger players, and more skilful players, but Italy’s captain was absolutely indomitable. He played every minute of every match, made 103 tackles (24 more than anyone else in the tournament) and led them to their best ever record.

Tommaso Menoncello. Bundee Aki is probably the correct answer, while François Cros has a strong claim too, but Menoncello enjoyed a fantastic tournament with Italy, never more so than when filling in on the wing against France.

Italy’s captain joked that he is getting old after Saturday’s victory in Cardiff, but it does feel as if Michele Lamaro has waited an age for a team to match his example. He has endured difficult times and richly deserves their success.

Take your pick. Outstanding performers everywhere. Never has a Six Nations seen so many. But if you are a hooker who finds yourself scoring more points than another team’s goal-kicker you must be doing something right. Dan Sheehan has it all.

## Match of the tournament
France v England in Lyon had almost everything. A flawed classic, perhaps, but the atmosphere was outstanding and both France and England frequently attacked with purpose and class. The similarly electric England v Ireland game a week earlier was a close second.

There were plenty of good ones, with 10 of the games settled by five points or less, but England’s win against Ireland at Twickenham was a cut above any of the others. It was their best performance since 2019, and they still only won it by a point with a drop goal in the final minute.

England 23-22 Ireland. Twickenham hadn’t rocked like that in years and it edges out Saturday’s finale because there was much still at stake, whereas Ireland’s win over Scotland let off the shackles in Lyon. The first three rounds had been low on quality but the tournament sprang to life in round four and that was the highlight.

The French win in Lyon was memorable but, considering what was at stake for Ireland and England, their wild round‑four Twickenham classic ranks top. Marcus Smith derailed an Irish grand slam and steadied Steve Borthwick’s ship after the Murrayfield debacle.

Take your pick. Outstanding matches everywhere. Never has a Six Nations seen so many. England’s matches in rounds three, four and five were extraordinary, likewise Italy’s, Ireland’s opening win and Wales’s unfinished comeback against Scotland. England v Ireland clinches it for drama and jeopardy.

## Favourite moment
Landing back on terra firma after a storm-tossed flight to Dublin (we ended up being diverted to Belfast) for the Six Nations launch. And, look, I’m no Grace Dent, but if you ever find yourself in Lyon the food really is different gravy.

Nolann Le Garrec’s breakaway try against England after François Cros poached a lineout off George Martin was as good as any I’ve seen live in a while. The English defence barely managed a touch on any of the French attackers between them.

Stevie Mulrooney belting out Ireland’s Call, raising what is already a high bar for national anthems in this tournament. Honourable mentions for Le Garrec’s outrageous pass and the tunnel row between Andy Farrell and Steve Borthwick which might have won if it had gotten a little more heated.

Paolo Garbisi’s smile springs to mind. When the ball slipped off the tee in Rome before his opening penalty against Scotland, he accepted the repeat of his Lille calamity with good humour. But Smith’s drop goal was a championship-shaping intervention.

Take your pick. Outstanding moments everywhere. Never has a Six Nations seen so many. But Le Garrec’s 25-metre reverse pass against Wales gets it. Too often such skills come off as showboating, but this one was demanded by the moment. France nearly scored a beauty off it.

## Biggest surprise
It would have been Italy beating France in Lille, had the ball not toppled from the tee as Garbisi was set to kick the winning points. Everyone knew Italy were improving but their rejuvenated confidence since the World Cup has been wonderful to behold.

England’s win against Ireland aside, the way Italy fought back after losing their first two games and then going seven points down to France in Lille showed a resilience no one outside the team can really have known they had in them.

I expected there to be a World Cup hangover, but I didn’t think it would be for France and I did not see them being beaten at home by Ireland so emphatically. It is to Italy’s great credit that the manner of their victory over Wales wasn’t particularly surprising at all.

Monty Ioane said “not much has changed” for Italy, which shows a mindset shift and a few tactical tweaks can go a long way. The surprise is not that they’re winning, but that they suddenly look so comfortable.
