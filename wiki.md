### Standard disclaimer [standard-disclaimer]

## Updates from [previous report](ELMLargeScaleAndPerformanceReportRelease701): This report provides an update to IBM Engineering Test Management (ETM) 7.0.2 performance and scalability test, from the [7.0.1 release](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/ELMLargeScaleAndPerformanceReportRelease701).

#### Datashape

In this release, the datashape has been evolved as outlined below

-   Number of components: total number of components is increased from
    11 to 2511
-   Repository size\[1\]: increased from 15 million to 20 million total
    artifacts, or by 33
-   ETM Database size on disk has grown from 775GB to 1171GB
-   Component size\[1\]:
    -   added small (\<1K), medium (5K), and large (50K) sizes
    -   keeping extra large (500K) and extra-extra-large (10M) sizes

\[1\]: measured by total number of versioned artifacts generated by the
[Data Generation Tool](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/RQMDatagen)
which collects the sum from each artifact type visible in the UI.

The size and number of different components are summarized in the table
below TABLE{ sort="off" headerbg="#3399FF" cellpadding="2"
cellspacing="2" dataalign="center" caption="versioned test artifact
counts by component size: " tableborder="2" tableframe="border"
tablerules="none"}

| Counts | Extra-extra large component(10M) | Extra large component(500K) | Large(50K) | Medium(5K) | Small(\<1K) | Sum in Repo |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| test plans | 1,681 | 50 | 6 | 4 | 1 | 6,281 |
| test cases | 1,000,207 | 30,000 | 3,000 | 400 | 20 | 1,670,207 |

| test phases and test environments | 31,636 | 800 | 92 | 63 | 20 | 112,586 |
| build definitions and build records | 33,533 | 1,006 | 120 | 70 | 25 | 131,093 |
| Total \# of artifacts per component | 10,716,574 | 561,280 | 56,518 | 4,937 | 256 | 21,888,924 |
| Total \# of components in repository | 1 | 10 | 50 | 450 | 2000 | 2,511 |
| Newly added in 702 | N | N | Y | Y | Y | \- |

#### Configuration test coverage

The performance and load tests of small, medium, and large sized
components are evaluated under Global Configuration (GC) for this
release. The GC component is consisted of all 2500 ETM components. The
extra and extra-extra large sized components remain to be tested against
their local ETM configurations including both streams and baselines for
regression purpose.

#### Disclaimer

The extra-extra-large sized component was created initially to expediate
the growth of the repository without consideration of artifact versions
(i.e. the artifacts were generated in an opt-out environment prior to
the enablement of Configuration Management feature). The test against
this particular component was initially experimental during 7.0, but it
continuously serves as a way to regression test the performance of IBM
IBM Engineering Test Management (ETM). The results using this component
can represent edge cases due to its huge size, thus the measurement for
the performance of this component shown in the report should be looked
at and analyzed as a comparison of the performance of different releases
in the context of datashape. It should not be deemed as a performance
benchmark.

## Summary of regression test results

We continue to find the following performance characteristics as we keep
increasing the size of the repository

#### Component performance vs. component size For any given repository size, generally:

-   The smaller a component, the faster page response times or better
    performance for that component. Under the 20 million repository, for
    components that have a size ranged from small to large, 98 of the
    individual page response times are under 2 seconds (with the
    exception of Dashboard loading being 4 seconds, and Saving a test
    plan may take 5 seconds due to large amount of iterations defined);
    whereas 11 out of 120 pages are exceeding 5 seconds for the
    extra-large component, most of these slower pages are
    browsing/searching a given artifact type that has a larger total
    count, including searching/filtering test case results (9 seconds)
    and test case records (5.5 seconds) in the default views within a
    stream.

The detailed analysis of the component performance as a function of
component size can be found in [ETM 7.0.1 Performance
Report](ELMLargeScaleAndPerformanceReportRelease701). Its worthy to note
that since the component size can vary substantially, each of the
individual test load was only focused on homogeneously sized components.
Carrying out test loads this way not only leads to statistically
normalization of page response times, but also allows servers to warmup
thoroughly and database become more optimal.

#### Component performance vs. growing repository size

-   The general performance of a given component\[2\] degrades as the
    repository size grows. Although the measurements based on
    extre-extra-large sized component stress tested some edge cases, we
    observed a projection of a slight degradation when comparing between
    the 15-million repository and the 10-million repository, yet a minor
    to moderate degradation in comparing the 20-million repository to
    the 15-million repository. The degradation degree for 500K component
    is still minor under 20-million repository (average page response
    time for all pages degraded by less than 10, comparing to 15-million
    repository).
-   Within a component context, the pages that are more sensitive to the
    size of the entire repository include those embracing the largest
    test artifact counts, for instances, in our test environment, page
    Browse Test Case Execution Records (total count of 4 million in a
    single component, or 30 of total artifact count in the repository),
    Browse Test Case Results, and the relevant pages to search/filter
    the test artifact.

For a detailed analysis of the component performance as a function of
repository size, please refer to [ETM 7.0.1 Performance
Report](ELMLargeScaleAndPerformanceReportRelease701).

\[2\]: component size did not grow prior to the performance load test.

## Whats not in scope of test for this release

Like all previous releases, scalability that may be impacted by any of
the following dimensions are not covered in 7.0.2 tests -

-   The growth of number of baselines for a given component or stream
-   The growth of number of versions for a given configuration
-   The growth of number of states for a given artifact

# Jazz Security Architecture and Jazz Authorization Server [jazz-security-architecture-and-jazz-authorization-server]

DKGRAY Authors: Main.ShubjitNaik Build basis: Jazz Authorization Server
6.x, 7.x ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

BRStarting with the CLM 6.0 software release, Jazz Security Architecture
(JSA) SSO is available as an authentication option. Based on [OpenID
Connect](http://openid.net/connect/faq), the authentication is not
performed by the container hosting Jazz applications, but instead is
delegated to a separate Jazz Authorization Server (JAS), which performs
the role of an OpenID Connect provider (OP). JAS also provides Single
Sign On feature to the applications that are configured with it. BR
BRInformation related to Jazz Security Architecture is extracted from
our jazz.net article [Jazz Server Authentication
Explained](https://jazz.net/library/article/75) BR

## About OIDC, JSA and JAS

The [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](http://openid.net/connect) authentication
protocol was established in early 2015 as an extension of the [OAuth
2.0](https://oauth.net/2) protocol, designed to be easier to adopt
across a wide range of clients (native applications, browsers,
browser-based applications, and mobile devices). It is extensible and
configurable (with optional features). OpenID Connect is a simple
identity protocol and open standard that is built on top of the OAuth
2.0 protocol that enables client applications to rely on authentication
that is performed by an OpenID Connect Provider to verify the identity
of a user. OpenID is a protocol for authentication while OAuth is for
authorization. (Authentication is about making sure that the guy you are
talking to is indeed who he claims to be. Authorization is about
deciding what that guy should be allowed to do)

For additional information on OIDC and the authentication flow visits
our [Infocenter
page](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/cwlp_openid_connect.html).

Jazz Security Architecture is a particular profile of OIDC, specifying
which optional features are included, and a few extensions.
Authentication is handled by a separate OpenID provider (OP, in our case
it would be our Jazz Authorization Server); Jazz applications delegate
to that provider instead of relying on the application server to handle
authentication. Jazz Authorization Server is based on the IBM WebSphere
Liberty server. Because Jazz Authorization Server authenticates users,
it must be configured with a user registry.

When a user logs into a Jazz application, JAS (OP) generates a token for
the user (known as a bearer token) that can then be used to authenticate
with any application that is configured with the same OP. Therefore,
Jazz Security Architecture provides a single sign-on experience that is
independent of the type of application container, unlike Kerberos,
WebSphere, and Tomcat single sign-on mechanisms. Single sign-on is
supported across all applications that are configured to use the same
JAS.

Configuring Jazz applications for Jazz Security Architecture SSO is
either done at install time, for new installations, or done as a
migration procedure, for existing installations that are using some
other form of authentication.

### Application To Application Authentication

In addition to authenticating end users that access Jazz applications,
applications also authenticate requests sent by other applications. In
particular, applications that participate in Open Services Lifecycle
Collaboration use linked data to share and connect resources across
application development domains. There are two forms of
application-to-application authentication implemented by Jazz
applications, OAuth 1.0a and OpenID Connect.

Up until the 6.0 software release, OAuth 1.0a was the only type of
inter-application authentication supported. It requires pair-wise
relationships between communicating applications - applications that are
registered as "friends" of each other can send requests to each other
that will be authenticated using OAuth 1.0a. For bi-directional
communications, each application must be a friend of each other. The
friending application is allocated a key and secret which it uses to
authenticate with the friend application.

When applications are configured with Jazz Security Architecture SSO
enabled, they can use OpenID Connect to authenticate with each other. In
that case, no pair-wise relationships are needed between applications
for authentication purposes; no "keys" or "secrets" are held by
applications in order to authenticate with each other. Instead, when a
user authenticates with an application that has Jazz Security
Architecture SSO enabled, that user is automatically authenticated with
all other applications that are registered with the same Jazz
Authorization Server as the first application. Therefore, applications
can invoke services in other applications on behalf of the user without
requiring additional logins.

## Advantages Of Using JAS

Jazz Security Architecture is one of our Authentication and Single
Sign-On (SSO) solution for Jazz Application starting CLM 6.x. JSA
eliminates the requirement for paired configuration of OAuth consumer
keys. All applications that are configured for Jazz Security
Architecture SSO can communicate with each other without a configuration
for every possible source and destination relationship.

**OAuth 2.0**

When deployed with Jazz Authorization Server (IBM Liberty OIDC feature)
ELM supports OAuth 2.0.

Up until the 6.0 software release, OAuth 1.0a was the only type of
inter-application authentication supported. Starting CLM version 6.0
Jazz Authorization Server was introduced and when applications are
configured with Jazz Security Architecture SSO enabled, they can use
OpenID Connect to authenticate with each other. OpenID Connect is a
simple identity protocol and open standard that is built on top of the
OAuth 2.0 protocol that enables client applications to rely on
authentication that is performed by an OpenID Connect Provider to verify
the identity of a user.

Here are the articles available on OAuth 2.0 and ELM.

-   [OAuth 2.0 and Accessing ELM Resources](ELMAndOAuth20)
-   [OAuth 2.0 Access flow with ELM Configured with Third Party OIDC
    Provider](ELMAndOAuth20WithOIDCProvider)
-   [ELM and OAuth 2.0 Server to Server communication via Client
    Credentials Grant](ELMAndOAuth20ServerToServer)

**SAML or OIDC Providers - Authentication and SSO via Third Party
Identity Providers**

As JAS is a Liberty OpenID Connect Provider, it can be configured to
further delegate authentication to a [SAML Identity
Provider](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYMRC_7.0.2/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_jsasso_jas_user_mgmt_saml.html)
or a [Third Party OIDC Provider](JASandOIDCProvider).

-   SSO is achieved across different vendor applications along with ELM
    applications connected to the SAML or OIDC Provider
-   Possibility to Leverage Multi-Factor Authentication via Third Party
    Identity Providers
-   Limitations
    -   Until version 7.0.1, Multi Factor Authentication Works only for
        Web Clients
-   Starting version 7.0.2 you can configure [Application
    Passwords](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/ApplicationPasswordsForNativeClients)
    for Non-Web Clients

**Reduced Maintenance**

-   JAS would be the only server to be configured for Authentication and
    JTS for User to group role mappings
    -   On a distributed setup without JAS, each application server
        (profile) hosting Jazz applications need to configured with LDAP
        and Group Mappings need to be setup
-   Changes to Group Mappings does not need a restart, reducing the
    maintenance time of restarting each Application server hosting Jazz
    applications

**Federated User Registries**

-   We can configure [JAS with SCIM](JASSCIMFederatedRepositories) for
    seamless Synchronization of Users from multiple user registries

# Add database tables (CCM, QM, JTS) [add-database-tables-ccm-qm-jts]

DKGRAY Authors: [UpgradeTroubleshootingTeam](UpgradeTroubleshootingTeam)
Build basis: CLM 4.x and later ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

This page will discuss troubleshooting techniques and known issues that
arise during the addTables step in the upgrade process.

## Troubleshooting

During this step in the upgrade process, a log file appended with
\_addTables will be created in the ../server directory of the
Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM) application installation
directory. An example of this file is: repotools-ccm_addTables.log

## Known Issues

Below are some known issues which arise during the addTables step in the
upgrade process

### Jazz Team Server errors

This section will discuss errors common when adding database tables to
the Jazz Team Server (JTS) database.

#### Invalid object name 'RIODS.TIMELINE'

**Version:** Upgrade to 4.0.0.1 **Error During Upgrade:** Invalid object
name 'RIODS.TIMELINE'. com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException:
Invalid object name 'RIODS.TIMELINE'. **Cause:** This error is caused by
[defect
231471](https://jazz.net/jazz/web/projects/Jazz20Foundation#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=231471)
which is fixed in 4.0.1. You will notice this errors if you do not have
a DW schema setup for your current JTS server before proceedng the
upgrade. **Resolution:** This error can be ignored as it does not block
your JTS from upgrading successfully.

### CCM-specific errors

This section will discuss errors common when adding Database tables to
the Rational Team Concert (CCM) database.

#### CRJAZ0350I Error fetching item values

**Version:** Upgrade to 4.x **Error During Upgrade:** CRJAZ0350I Error
fetching item values. statement = Select S.VAL_ENCODING, S.ITEM_VALUE
From REPOSITORY.ITEM_STATES S Join REPOSITORY.ITEM_TYPES T on
T.ITEM_UUID = S.ITEM_UUID Where S.KEY_UUID = ? parameter\[0\] = xxxxxxx
**Cause:** There are some corrupted item states in your current ccm
repository database. They need to be fixed first before procceding ccm
upgrade. **Resolution:** Run [Online Verify Tool
](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/L3DevTool) to try identifying the
problematic item state and fixing them. The best practice is to perform
data integrity check against your current jts and ccm repository DBs to
ensure data is in a consistent state **prior** to proceeding the
upgrade.

### QM-specific errors

|             |
|-------------|
| IN PROGRESS |

This section will discuss errors common when adding Database tables to
the Rational Quality Manager (QM) database.

### RM-specific errors

|             |
|-------------|
| IN PROGRESS |

This section will discuss errors common when adding Database tables to
the Rational Requirements Composer (RM) database.

### Errors that can occur with any CLM application

This section will discuss errors common when adding the Database tables
to any application within the CLM (they are not application specific).

#### CRJAZ1093I xxxx service class was not activated

**Version:** Any upgrade version 4.x **Error During Upgrade:**
CRJAZ1093I xxxx service class was not activated **Cause:** The server is
unable to connect to the repository database to perform the addTables
command. **Resolution:** Ensure the jdbc driver is in the proper
location according to upgrade instruction and it is compatible with the
JDK version repotools runs on. For example, when connecting to SQL
server DB, sqljdbc.jar works with the JDK 1.5, sqljdbc4.jar works with
the JDK 1.6. For Oracle, JDK 1.5 use ojdbc5.jar, JDK 1.6 use ojdbc6.jar.
The ojdbc14.jar driver will not connect to Oracle 11G etc.

#### ORA-01031: Insufficient privileges

**Version:** Any upgrade version 4.x **Error During Upgrade:**
java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01031: insufficient privileges **Cause:** The
JDBC Connection user does not have enough privileges to run the
necessary commands to add the tables to the database. **Resolution:**
Ensure the JDBC Connection user has DBO permissions on all CLM
applications, including databases for jts, qm, ccm, dw and rm. Note that
the creation of the warehouse on Oracle requires more permissions as
compared to other databases. When you specify the database user in the
connection spec for data warehouse, ensure that the database user has
DBA permissions. Then you can configure a smaller subset of permissions
after the original creation, as identified on [More Control Over the
Oracle DW
Setup](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/MoreControlOverTheOracleDataWarehouseSetup)
article.

#### Unable to create Index MARKERS_UNIQUE_MARKER

**Version:** 4.0.4, SQL Server DB (may also occur on Oracle DB) **Error
During Upgrade:** The following SQL query did not execute properly on
the server: CREATE UNIQUE INDEX MARKERS_UNIQUE_MARKER May be followed by
oracle error: ORA-01450: maximum key length (6398) exceeded **Cause:**
This is caused by a 900 byte limit on MS SQL DBs, where the UUIDs are
too long and hit the byte limit. **Resolution:** This is a known defect
tracked via [jazz.net Defect
280057](https://jazz.net/jazz/web/projects/Jazz20Foundation#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=280057),
planned to be resolved in 4.0.5. This is referenced in the following
techote: [Upgrading CLM products to version 4.0.4 fails when using
Microsoft SQL
Server](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21649768)

As a **workaround**, only upgrade to 4.0.3, or [contact IBM
Support](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/rational/support/contact.html)
for a hotfix on 4.0.4. On **Oracle** DB, a similar error may occur due
to the NLS_SEMANTICS_LENGTH configuration being *char*. Changing this to
*byte* will resolve the issue.

# Administrative utilities, tools, and scripts [administrative-utilities-tools-and-scripts]

DKGRAY Authors: Main.DanToczala Build basis: Varies for each asset
ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

This page describes and links to more information about useful
utilities, tools, and scripts for Jazz administrators and Jazz users.
The tools are provided on an "as-is" basis.

## Administrator utilities

These utilities, tools, and scripts are intended to ease administrative
tasks.

-   [JTSMon](JTSMonTool) - JTSMon is a new tool that you can use to make
    more sense out of Jazz server traffic patterns based on web service
    reports. Also, check out the [FAQ for JTSMon](JTSMonFAQ), where you
    can download the utility.
-   [Automation
    server](https://rsjazz.wordpress.com/2013/07/15/boost-your-automation-performance-using-an-automation-server/) -
    This blog article describes the process of creating an automation
    server, which can complete the automation tasks that you might need
    for your CLM implementation. The automation server was originally
    created as a performance improvement to [automate the insertion of
    comments into a work item from the command
    line](http://rsjazz.wordpress.com/2013/07/12/work-item-command-line-client-to-add-a-comment/).
-   [Sample upgrade scripts](SampleUpgradeScripts) - These scripts are
    based on scripts that are used to upgrade Jazz.net and Rational
    functional verification test environments.

## Reporting utilities

These utilities, tools, and scripts are intended to provide simple
reports for various Jazz administrative needs.

-   [Simple baseline diff
    tool](http://dtoczala.wordpress.com/2011/01/14/simple-rtc-release-notes-script/) -
    This blog post by Main.DanToczala has a simple baseline diff tool
    for generating release notes. The tool is unsupported.
-   [Listing project area membership in Rational Team Concert and
    Rational Quality
    Manager](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/ListingProjectAreaMembershipinRTCRQM) -
    This paper, written by Carl Girourd, describes how to list a set of
    users that have membership to a project area in an easily consumable
    format. The procedure in this paper is unsupported.

### How are my project areas configured?

You want a list of how your projects are organized, and everything
inside of them. How do you do it? In the Eclipse client, open the Team
Organization view, right-click a project area, and click **Generate
Runtime Report**. A .zip file is exported that contains the project and
team area hierarchy, member assignments, and the process XML
configuration. However, the .zip file does not contain the work item
categories ("filed against" values). This technique is useful for
assessing how your project is organized.

## Miscellaneous utilities

These utilities, tools, and scripts do not easily fit into one of the
other categories.

# Common issues that occur after an upgrade [common-issues-that-occur-after-an-upgrade]

Authors: [UpgradeTroubleshootingTeam](UpgradeTroubleshootingTeam) Build
basis: CLM 4.x ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

This page will discuss some troubleshooting steps to take when issues
are incurred after the upgrade.

## Known issues (application non-specific)

This section will discuss some known issues which occur after the
upgrade.

### Unable to create an LPA project

**Symptom:** When creating a new project, you may see errors such as the
following: Error instantiating the template: CRJCA0003E CRJCA0003E The
Lifecycle Project Administration (LPA) application made a request that
was answered by an unexpected response code. The request was:
<https://>.../ccm/clmSampleProject. The response was: HTTP/1.1 400 Bad
Request. **Cause:** Process templates need to be redeployed
**Resolution:** See [Redeploying Predefined
Templates](RedeployingPredefinedTemplates) for instructions on how to
redeploy the templates.

**Symptom:** Selecting 'save' button on LPA Creation page results in
nothing **Environment:** CLM in a distributed environment **Cause:** One
of the applications needs to be authorized **Resolution:** Navigate to
one of the other links under the admin context (members, projects). At
the top of the page, one of your applications should prompt for
authorization.

### Failing integrations

**Symptom:** After upgrading your CLM install, the previously configured
integrations (OSLC links, synchronization, connectors) are not
functioning as they did prior to the upgrade. **Cause:**

-   Versions are no longer supported
-   Configuration is incorrect
-   New connector version must be downloaded

**Resolution:** Before upgrading, ensure that the new versions of the
product are supported. Once the upgrade has occured, ensure that the
configuration is still accurate. For more information on troubleshooting
integrations, see the [Integrations
Troubleshooting](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/IntegrationsTroubleshooting)
section of the wiki.

### Failing Queries or Dashboard query issues

If you are unable to run a query, or see dashboards failing to load, you
may need to [Reindex the applications](ReindexingAfterUpgrade).

### Failing Reports or Dashboard reports issues

**Symptom:** After upgrading your CLM install, reports or dashboard
reports fail, or show incorrect information. **Environment:** Apache
Derby Database for Data Warehouse **Cause:** The Apache Derby Database
for Data Warehouse was not moved from the pre-upgrade directory into the
new directory. Therefore, the current Data Warehouse database is empty.
**Resolution:** Copy the Apache Derby Data Warehouse location in the
pre-upgrade directory (../server/conf/jts/derby/DataWarehouse) to the
new directory. Afterwards, complete the Data Warehouse upgrade again by
running [repotools-jts
-upgradeWarehouse](https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/index.jsp?re=1&topic=/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/r_repotools_upgradewarehouse.html).

### Users unable to login

**Symptom:** After upgrading your CLM install, users are unable to login
to CLM. The following error may occur This user was not found in the
directory service. This user will not be able to login unless they have
an account in the directory service.ID CRJAZ1532I **Environment:** CLM
deployed on Apache Tomcat, using local file based authentication
(tomcat-users.xml) **Cause:** The file write behaviour for the
tomcat-users.xml file was changed between Tomcat 5.5 (RTC 3.x) and
Tomcat 7 (RTC 4.x) **Resolution:** See [Technote 1614661:
Tomcat-users.xml is file not updated after
Upgrade](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21614661)

**Symptom:** When accessing RRC (DOORS NG) when JTS has been upgraded to
5.x, users cannot access RRC/DOORS NG **Environment:** JTS at 5.0, RRC
at 4.x or 5.x **Cause:** RRC has changed to DOORS NG. **Resolution:**
You need to activate the DOORS NG licenses, or apply new licenses. These
licenses should already be assigned to your users, but the new CAL needs
to be applied.

### Unable to load or create work items

**Symptom:** After upgrade, work items cannot be viewed or created.
**Environment**: CLM versions 4.0.4 and below **Cause:** This is a known
defect in 4.0.4 **Resolution:** See [Creating or viewing a work item
results in a blank page and not an object error with RTC
4.0.4](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21652067)

## Known Issues (application specific)

Navigate to [Known
Issues](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/KnownIssues#Known_Workarounds)
and click on the application and version to see known issue and
workaround details (specific to application and version).

### RTC: Workspaces and Streams are disconnected

**Symptom:** After upgrade, workspaces and streams are disconnected. You
may see a NullPointerException. **Environment**: CLM versions 5.0,
Oracle backend database **Cause:** This is a known defect.
**Resolution:** See [NullPointerExceptions occur with Oracle DB after
migration to Rational Team Concert
5.0](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21676229)

## Where do I go from here? If you are unable to resolve your issue using the available online resources, please open a service request with IBM Rational Support. Refer to [Additional Troubleshooting Resources](DataCollectionandSupportResources) for further details.

## Recommended data gathering and subsequent analysis steps

When investigating problems that occur **after** the upgrade, collect
the following information: \* [ISALite Log
collection](https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/index.jsp?re=1&topic=/com.ibm.team.concert.doc/topics/t_using_the_isal.html)
\* All upgrade repotools log files located in the following directory:
/server

-   screenshots or relevant errors

It will also be helpful to gather the following information:

-   What was the behaviour like before the upgrade?
-   Besides the upgrade, did any other configuration change occur?

This page will discuss some troubleshooting steps to take when issues
are incurred after the upgrade.

## Using the applications

After the upgrade, you attempt to use Rational Requirements Composer and
are unable to use certain product functionality.

## RRC graphical editor plugin for IE and FF (RM Browser Add-On)

**Symptom:** When the RRC plugin for browsers is applied pre-upgrade, it
may not function post-upgrade. **Cause:** The RRC browser plugin needs
to be re-deployed after the upgrade. **Resolution:** Follow the [RM
Browser Add-On Installation, FAQ and Troubleshooting
Guide](https://jazz.net/library/article/1088) for instructions on how to
re-deploy the add-on. More information can also be found on the [RM

# AIX CPU spike [aix-cpu-spike]

DKGRAY Authors: Main.MichaelAfshar Build basis: AIX 6.1 or later
ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

Introductory paragraph: TBD

## AIX CPU monitoring

1.  system overview
2.  vmstat data with a 1 second granularity, timestamped
3.  top output (with a 2 or 3 second granularity)
4.  tprof data samples during the CPU spike
5.  javacores collected with a (say) 30 second granularity during the
    CPU spike
6.  snapshots of the "Active Services" running at the time of the CPU
    spike

### System overview

We start by trying to build up a picture of the CPU resources available
to the system. The kinds of questions we may have are:

1.  How many (virtual) processors are configured (or assigned to the
    LPAR)?
2.  What SMT level is enabled?
3.  If virtual, are the number of processors available to this LPAR
    capped, or uncapped? What is the entitlement for this Virtual
    Machine?
4.  Depending on the entitlement, and if uncapped, how large is the
    pool, and how many other LPARs share processors in this pool, how
    overcommitted is the pool of processors.

Running the AIX "lparstat -i" answers most of the questions we may have.

lparstat -i

We refer the reader to the lparstat man page for field by field
descriptions of this output. One may need to look at CEC data to build
up a more complete picture of the LPARs sharing a CPU pool with this
one.

### vmstat

To locate the time of the CPU spike, and to gain an insight into whether
user or system CPU is being consumed at this time, the best tool to use
is vmstat. The preferred flags to use for this are:

vmstat -wtI 1

This command should be issued in the background, wrapped with a nohup
command, and redirecting the output to a file. This will collect data
with a 1 second granularity. Please note that this level of granularity
is necessary for a comprehensive insight into the consumption of this
resource. A system administrator may well be running other tools that
are also collecting data (e.g. topasrec, or sar) with a larger (e.g. 5
minute or 15 minute) granularity - but this output, though useful for
capacity planning purposes, will not be helpful in the analysis of
possibly short-lived CPU spikes.

Check the vmstat output to identify the time of the CPU spike, its
duration, its amplitude, and whether, when CPU consumption is high,
whether this CPU is in kernel, user or wait I/O? Check also for
excessive paging.

### topas output

Log topas output to a file.

Analyze the top output to check if there one process consuming a lot of
CPU, or several, or many? If it is just the java process that is
consuming memory, see the next section. If processes other than java are
responsible for the CPU peak, ascertain if these really need to run on
this system.

### top output for threads Follow the directions in [AIX Java thread CPU monitoring](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/tools/index.jsp?topic=2Fcom.ibm.java.doc.igaa2F_1vg0001475cb4a-1190e2e0f74-8000_1006.html) to collect per thread data for the Java threads.

### javacores

Run the [waittool](https://wait.ibm.com/) to collect javacores at the
time of the CPU spike with a 30 second frequency. Look at the stack
traces of the java threads that (in the above output) are responsible
for most of the CPU consumption.

## Alternative topologies overview

This page describes the Alternative ALM Deployment Topologies for
version 6.x. Refer to [Standard deployment topologies
overview](StandardTopologiesOverview) for high-level description of the
standard topologies, how they are categorized and their key
characteristics.

These alternative deployment topologies for the Rational solution for
Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) are a subset of the standard ALM
deployment topologies. For the rest of the standard topologies, see
[Recommended ALM deployment topologies
6.x](RecommendedALMDeploymentTopologies6).

## Alternate evaluation topology

### (ALM-V1) Evaluation - Single server / Tomcat / Derby

This is a simple, single server topology whose primary use is supporting
evaluations, demonstrations, proofs of concept and training. Given the
use of Derby and Tomcat, it can be stood up very quickly, especially
with the express install feature. Note that the VVC application is only
present in release 6.0 and has been incorporated in other applications
in later releases.

## Applying the topologies

Every customer's environment is different with unique, necessary and
often immutable requirements and constraints. We recognize that these
standard topologies may not provide enough detail to make them
immediately implementable in some customer environments, but we wanted
to describe several topologies with enough variability to give an
indication of what is possible and where our recommendations start.

While we recommend customers start with a standard topology that is most
applicable to them, we recognize they will need to make changes and
customizations to support their own unique requirements and constraints.
IBM will support your own implementations, but may ask you to describe
which topology is most applicable to your deployment and ask you to
document what is unique in your environment to expedite any potential
support situation.

To aid you in documenting your chosen deployment topology, we have made
the following Rational Software Architect (RSA) model files available:

-   [ALM standard topologies
    6.x](ATTACHURL/com.ibm.alm.deployments.6.0.0.zip)

These may be imported into RSA then further modified or expanded to
represent your environment. Look at the Installation_Instructions.txt
file for information on how to import the models into RSA.

### Datasheets and sizing guidelines

Find ALM-specific performance datasheets, sizing guidelines and
performance-related case studies on the [Performance datasheets and
sizing guidelines page](PerformanceDatasheetsAndSizingGuidelines).

### Next steps

This topic is meant to briefly introduce these standard topologies and
describe how they might be applied. Work is already underway to build
upon and apply them. Subsequent updates to this topic and supporting
topics will provide additional insight into their usage.

Future updates to this topic or supporting topics may cover:

-   Deeper look at select topologies
-   Provide suggested tuning parameters
-   Consider high availability database topologies
-   Begin to expand this topology model into other domains
-   Discussion of strategic integrations with other IBM and non-IBM
    products.

# Approaches to implementing high availability and disaster recovery for Jazz environments DKGRAY Authors: Main.TimFeeney, Main.RichRakich Build basis: ELM 7.x [approaches-to-implementing-high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-for-jazz-environments-dkgray-authors-main.timfeeney-main.richrakich-build-basis-elm-7.x]

ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

***Please note: as announced with CLM v4.0.6: IBM will be simplifying
the approach to High Availability (HA) for the Rational CLM/Jazz
platform. Customers and IBM are increasingly using other technologies,
such as cloud and virtualization strategies, that provide a solution
which adapts to business demands for both availability and scale in a
cost-effective manner. IBM will be removing support for WebSphere
Application Server based application clustering from the CLM/Jazz
platform for version 5.0. Many of the customers who have evaluated
WebSphere Application Clustering decided that it was too expensive and
complex for the benefits provided for Jazz applications and exceeded
their required availability.***

This set of topic pages provides guidance on potential ways to implement
HA and Disaster Recovery (DR) for Jazz environments using capabilities
of the platforms and middleware you have chosen to deploy your Rational
Jazz environment on. Often this enables you to reuse existing
procedures, configurations and technologies that already use for other
IT systems. There are numerous different approaches, technologies and
implementation options, so this set of topic pages will focus on the
most commonly available and used approaches and technologies. The
implementation options are usually constrained by your organizations
existing approach to using these technologies for HA and DR, so in many
situations we will only provide general guidelines and best practice to
point your infrastructure administrators in the right direction.
Therefore, for many of implementation options we will not provide
detailed installation and configuration guides. Also you should rely
upon the documentation, guidance and best practice, services and support
of middleware vendors to install and configure the respective
middleware.

This page aims to provide pragmatic and cost-effective approaches to
achieving HA and DR that meet your requirements and needs. There is the
trade-off between costs/complexity of the approach and the level of
availability you can achieve, see [Pragmatic approach to achieving your
required HA and DR](#PragmaticApproach).

Please read to following introductory topics to gain an understanding of
key HA and DR principles:

-   [High availability principles](HighAvailability)
-   [Disaster recovery principles](DisasterRecovery)

## Plan for failure

Despite the best guidance, best practice, planning, deployment and
management, your Jazz development environment will someday fail. When
properly designed,
[implemented](DisasterRecovery#DRProcessAndProcedures) and
[practiced](DisasterRecovery#QuarterlyRecoveryDrills), HA and DR
approaches will help you manage failure and recovery within acceptable
time frames. If HA, DR, and backup procedures and policies are habits,
then downtime is reduced.

You must recommend and implement suitable HA and DR to meet the
customers ***REAL*** requirements and needs:

-   HA is system design and implementation that achieves system and data
    availability most or all of the time
    -   HA usually focuses on availability within the primary datacenter
-   DR leverages technology and automation to ensure business continuity
    in the event of an unanticipated event
    -   DR usually focuses on failover to a secondary datacenter
    -   Backup is the most basic part of DR and should always be a part
        of a DR solution
-   You are likely to achieve higher availability than you target if you
    focus on the right aspects

\#PragmaticApproach

## Pragmatic approach to achieving your required HA and DR

An administration team that is developing a HA and/or DR plan for a
development environment must weigh the need to recover quickly and
completely against the cost to implement the recovery. Also the impact
to the I/O performance of the environment should be considered, as well
as the environment [recovery time objective
(RTO)](DisasterRecovery#RecoveryTimeObjective). In other words, how much
time is available to fully recover the environment with all critical
development operations up and running again? Another important factor to
consider is the environment's [recovery point objective
(RPO)](DisasterRecovery#RecoveryPointObjective): How much data is lost,
or at what actual recovery point-in-time is all data current?

***[The expense of
availability](http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg247700.pdf)***

The above image shows that there is an important balance between the
costs of failure, and the costs of HA and DR.

HA and DR requirements for systems that support business or national
critical capabilities, such as stock-exchanges, government agencies,
hospitals, banks or e-commerce website, are likely to be much higher
that a typical development environment, unless the development
environment needs to have similar available as the system it supports.
Even in this situation the required availability is usually less that
the business or national critical system!

As you design your HA and DR strategy, consider the inconveniences
(costs) if your SCM system goes down for: 1 day, 4 hours, 1 hour, 15
minutes, 15 seconds, etc. In many cases, the costs of ensuring very
small outage windows are not offset by the organization cost to design,
implement and practice HA/DR.

Additional business continuity costs can include:

-   Hardware and software
    -   Additional datacenters, servers, physical components
    -   Additional software, licenses
-   People
    -   Product admins, IT admins, off-site contractors, 3rd-party
    -   Business continuity procedures, planning, training,
        implementation, testing
    -   And after deployment, remember to practice, practice, practice
-   Determining when to actually implement HA and DR
    -   Monitoring: automatic and/or manual
    -   Tools, logging, policies, procedures
    -   And of course, more practice, practice, practice

Only consider and implement a HA and/or DR solution that you are sure
your organization is capable of supporting. If your organization has no
experience with a technology or lack of general administrative maturity
to supporting it, poorly implementing and supporting it may cause more
outages than it is intended to prevent!

Make sure that your organization [measures the actual
availability](HighAvailability#MeasuringAvailability) it achieves.
Document potential and actual failure scenarios within your
organization, and use them to incrementally improve you HA and DR
solution to further meet your needs.

## Typical and realistic requirements for HA and DR for a Rational Jazz environment

Below are listed the key measure of HA and DR and respective realistic
and typical requirements that customer and IBM development environments
have:

-   **[Availability](HighAvailability#AvailabilityNumberOfNines)** -
    Most customers have an availability requirement for their
    development environment in the range of 99.5 - 99.7 for supported
    business operating hours. A few customer have a ***REAL***
    requirement for 99.9 availability, but be very careful not to set
    your requirement higher than needed as the cost of achieving very
    high levels of availability can be prohibitive! Further, many
    customer focus their requirement for HA within their primary
    datacenter and explicitly exclude DR scenarios requiring failover to
    a secondary datacenter or major rebuild of the primary datacenter.
    It is often useful to understand the required availability of
    similar systems within your organization and the level of
    availability supported by [common IT services that you could
    reuse](DeploymentPlanning#ReuseCommonManagedITInfrastructureServices),
    which will help you define a realistically achievable and needed
    requirement for availability.

<!-- -->

-   **[Mean time to recovery
    (MTTR)](HighAvailability#MeanTimetoRecovery)** - Again we often see
    MTTR requirements for recovery focused on HA within the primary
    datacenter, rather than DR scenarios. We see typically see MTTR
    requirements in the range of 2-6 hours for a development environment
    within the primary datacenter.

<!-- -->

-   **[Recovery point objective
    (RPO)](DisasterRecovery#RecoveryPointObjective)** - Most
    organizations base their required RPO on a nightly or once a day
    [offline back-up](BackupCLM). This constrains your achievable RPO to
    24 hours with recovery point in time at the time of the back-up.

<!-- -->

-   **[Recovery time objective
    (RTO)](DisasterRecovery#RecoveryTimeObjective)** - The required RTO
    we see in customers is usually in the range of 4 hours to 2 days.
    However, most organizations realize that in the event of a major
    primary datacenter failure, the development environment will often
    be one of the last systems to be restored.

\#FailureScenarios

## Failure scenarios with general approach to resolving failure and possible platform/middleware implementations

| Failure scenario | General approach to resolving failure | Possible platform/middleware implementations | Possible MTTR for HA and achievable RTO for DR |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Jazz application failure** | Monitoring scripts detect that the Jazz application is unavailable Scripts try to restart the Jazz application a number of times If the Jazz application does not restart successfully, consider applying the approach to resolving a WAS failure **NOTE: depending on experience, cost and complexity of setting-up the application monitoring and recovery, you could treat a Jazz application failure using the same approach as a single application server failure** | [Jazz application recovery using PowerHA](ImplementingApplicationHAUsingPowerHA#JazzApplicationRecovery) [Jazz application recovery using VMware HA](ImplementingApplicationHAUsingVMwareHA#JazzApplicationRecovery) | 5 - 10 minutes |
| **WAS failure** | Monitoring scripts detect that WAS is unavailable Scripts try to restart WAS a number of times and then the Jazz application(s) If WAS does not restart successfully, consider applying the approach to a single application server failure **NOTE: depending on experience, cost and complexity of setting-up the WAS monitoring and recovery, you could treat a WAS failure using the same approach as a single application server failure** | [WAS recovery using PowerHA](ImplementingApplicationHAUsingPowerHA#WasRecovery) [WAS recovery using VMware HA](ImplementingApplicationHAUsingVMwareHA#WasRecovery) [Example script for a Jazz deployment on WebSphere](ImplementingApplicationRecoveryExampleScript) [Warm standby WebSphere Application Server recovery using WebSphere Network Deployment](WarmStandbyWASRecoveryUsingWASND) | 10 - 15 minutes |
| **Single application server failure** | This could be due to HW, OS or 3rd party SW errors or failures The middleware hypervisor detects the failure and invokes the restart or fail over of the application server | [Single LPAR recovery using PowerHA](ImplementingApplicationHAUsingPowerHA#SingleLPARRecovery) [Single virtual server recovery using VMware HA](ImplementingApplicationHAUsingVMwareHA#SingleVirtualServerRecovery) | 15 - 20 minutes |
| \* Database failure\* | This could be due to the database servers, storage or network connections failing | [Database recovery](DatabaseRecovery) | 15 minutes to 4 hours |
| **Web server tier failure** | A common strategy for HA in the web server tier is the use of a load balancer that feeds a reverse proxy server |  | 15 minutes - 2 hours |
| **Jazz indexes corrupted** | This should never happen due to a Jazz application, WAS or single application server failure The only time this could happen is due to a storage corruption | [Jazz indexes, backup and recovery considerations](JazzIndexesBackupAndRecoveryConsiderations) | 1 - 24 hours |
| **Primary data center or site failure** | A lost or inaccessible site will likely entail loss of ALL Jazz server resources and some data loss This failure might be due to natural (fire, flood, tornado etc.) or human (hacking, malicious damage, stupidity etc.) failure **Note:** often re-establishing a development environment will be less of a priority than re-establishing other business critical systems | DR using PowerHA and database back-up or clustering TBD DR using VMware technologies and database back-up or clustering TDB | 4 hours to 2 days |
| **Network failure** | The local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN) is offline Users will notice that all applications (including Jazz applications) are unresponsive Users that are developing in Eclipse workspaces will be able to continue their work on software development assets, but no data will be stored to the Jazz repositories Often, networks may experience significant slowdown, but they are rarely offline If there is a network outage, it impacts all users and will be handled by IT support as a top priority problem. | No special procedures by the Jazz administrators are warranted | 15 minutes to 2 days |
| **Storage failure** | This would be due to server disk, Storage Area Network (SAN) or Network Area Storage (NAS) failure Storage failure can cause loss of data, and users will notice that the Jazz applications and Jazz server seem either unresponsive, or unable to store changes (when information returned to user is from the server cache) Users that are developing in Eclipse workspaces will be able to continue their work on software development assets, but no data will be stored to the Jazz repositories The use of SAN and NAS technologies can help reduce the risk of a single disk failure causing an unplanned outage | [Storage recovery](StorageRecovery) | 15 minutes to 2 days |

*Please note*: If two or more failures occur at the same time, it will
probably take longer to recover than the longest MTTR of all the
individual failures. In a worst case scenarios, you will not be able to
restore all the individual parts of your Rational environment to a
consistent state, resulting in you having to recovering from your [Jazz
back-up](BackupCLM). For this reason it is essential that you always
back-up your environment on a regular basis as the last line of defense
for all HA and DR scenarios.

# Attempting to use Collaborative Lifecycle Management on Windows operating system leads to NativeOutOfMemoryException (NOOME). DKGRAY Authors: Main.NatarajanThirumeni , Main.PaulEllis Build basis: Engineering Lifecycle Management 5.x, 6.x, 7.x [attempting-to-use-collaborative-lifecycle-management-on-windows-operating-system-leads-to-nativeoutofmemoryexception-noome.-dkgray-authors-main.natarajanthirumeni-main.paulellis-build-basis-engineering-lifecycle-management-5.x-6.x-7.x]

TOC{title="Page contents"}

This article was originally scoped to explain a situation observed when
using Rational Team Concert (RTC) on Microsoft Windows 2008 R2 Operating
System which can result in a NativeOutOfMemoryException (NOOME). This
article has been updated due to similar observations being made on
Microsoft Windows operating systems in general, also including 2008 and
2012, during evaluation use of Engineering Lifecycle Management (ELM)
6.x

There have been additional use cases where we have observed native out
of memory exceptions, with the Engineering Lifecycle Management 7.x
suite, which are documented below with the advised actions to resolve.

A more comprehensive [Troubleshooting native memory
issues](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/619631) is available from
the IBM Java team. If this simple wiki page is insufficient, then IBM
Support recommend following the IBM Java reference document and create a
case with IBM Support.

## NOOMEs due to contention in the 4GB Windows memory space

Typically, we have observed NOOMEs when multiple Engineering Lifecycle
Management applications were collocated on the same Windows server. This
was especially prevalent when the Lifecycle Query Engine (LQE) had been
installed alongside all of the other ELM applications required in a
global configuration environment. This issue is one of many discussed in
the [Proof of Concept
Sizing](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/ProofOfConceptSizingIn6x)
page, where we discuss implications of architectural decisions and what
constitutes a supported configuration.

This tech note talks about Native out of memory error. Native OOM is
totally different from Out of Memory Error (java.lang.OutOfMemoryError).

This tech note is about debugging Native out of memory error on Windows
operating system. To debug NOOM - you'll have to collect number of
performance logs or use logs which were created when system ran out of
native memory error. Usually, these are essential logs to investigate
Native out of memory error:

Application logs (ELM application and WAS or Liberty Logs)

Java core,

verbose:gc

heapdump

In some cases, system core dumps.

IBM support teams, level 2 & 3 should be able to investigate these logs
to find out what may have caused an application server ran out of native
out of memory. Based on our experience, we want to document at least
couple of use cases where RTC ran out of native out of memory error.
With the help of this documentation, you may be able to look at the logs
on your own to see if you could take an appropriate action to prevent
NOOM.

On Windows OS, there are many cases where an application server could
ran out of native out of memory. Lets us take a look at two different
use cases of NOOM where EWM (Engineering Workflow Manager) is deployed
on a Window operating system.

There are a few options to resolve this problem. Please ensure that you
test whichever solution is preferred before implementing in your
production environment.

### **Use Case \#1 (NOOM due to a shortage of 32-bit address space)**

The ELM application server is running and unexpectedly the application
server crashes with a NOOME. The crash generates Java cores and heap
dumps and may even generate system core dumps. Looking at the Javacore
in the first few lines reads

java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: native memory exhausted /Detail
"java/lang/OutOfMemoryError" "native memory exhausted" received

and followed by NATIVEMEMINFO section shows various memory information
and its allocation:

NATIVEMEMINFO subcomponent dump routine

bytes / 1027 allocations

The allocation of VM and Garbage Collection indicate that this is due to
shortage of 32-bit address space. The address space allocation is
discussed in details in [IBM Java tech
note](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890), for
more information please read / review.

If
[Xmcrs](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/sdk-java-technology/8?topic=options-xmcrs)
does not help, you may consult with IBM support.

Note, changes to Xmcrs require a an application server restart.

#### When using Link Index Provider (LDX)

We have seen the most successful remedy has been to use the Microsoft
article [FAQ for Development on 64-bit
Windows](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb190527.aspx), which
states:

"On Windows, the operating system allocates memory in the lowest 4 GB of
address space by default until that area is full. A large -Xmx value
might be insufficient to avoid OutOfMemoryError exceptions.

Advanced users can change the default Windows allocation options by
setting the registry key named
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory
Management\AllocationPreference to (REG_DWORD) 0x100000.." This option
will force allocations in top-down order, instead of the lower areas of
RAM.

### **Use Case \#2 (NOOM due to a Direct Byte Buffers (DBB) allocation on top of available OS memory)**

Use case \#2, is similar to use case \#1, where you'll see Java core is
pointing out to "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: native memory exhausted".
However if you take a closer look in the core file, you'll see
application server is demanding high volume of Direct Byte Buffers. The
direct memory region is demanding more memory because, the users are
working with large files (examples, number of files in workspace and its
content, parallel workspace loads and workitem attachments). These large
files, could drive DBB region to run of native memory. Lets take a look
how to prevent:

a\) You may want to reduce amount of files which are being downloaded on
the client systems (developers workspace , build machines and etc). If
you believe client systems are repeatedly downloading same content from
the server then you should consider to introduce a content proxy server
to reduce load om the application server.

b\) If you can't control amount of files are being loaded on the client
systems, another option is provide more memory to operating system
itself which may prevent NOOM.

In our case \#2, system run out of native memory - to confirm this
symptoms, open a Java core, search for Direct Byte Buffers: under
NATIVEMEMINFO region

NATIVEMEMINFO subcomponent dump routine

**`=============================`**

\|JRE: 33,704,575,224 bytes / 1899498 allocations

............

\| \| \| +--Direct Byte Buffers: 15,169,455,128 bytes / 1832570
allocations

As you can see, Direct Byte Buffers is demanding over 15 GBs. And in our
case, the OS has 32 GB of RAM. The JVM is using 16 GB of heap.
Naturally, the OS don't have enough memory to go beyond 32 GBs. At this
point, native out of memory is expected as there isn't enough memory.

The changes to OS memory changes require a server restart.

### **Other Solutions**

If either of these use cases (use case \#1 or use case \#2) does not
help - its highly suggested go to to IBM support and seek for further
level of debugging.

By using Jython scripting, you can reduce the effort and resources
associated with common administration tasks in WebSphere Application
Server.

The following scripts are provided out of the box and can be used:

-   `clm_was_config.py` This script configures WebSphere Application
    Server settings.
-   `clm_deploy.py` This script deploys CLM applications on a single
    server.
-   `clm_deployed_distributed.py` This script deploys CLM applications
    in a distributed environment.
-   `clm_undeploy.py` This script removes previously deployed CLM
    applications.
-   `clm_undeploy_distributed.py` This script removes previously
    deployed CLM applications in a distributed environment.

**General Restriction:** The deploy and undeploy scripts are meant to be
used together. If you deploy the .WAR files in the WebSphere Integrated
Solutions Console without using the deploy script, then you must
undeploy the .WAR files by using the Integrated Solutions Console. If
the undeploy script is not working as expected, check the application
names in the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console. The deploy and
undeploy scripts use the application names with a dot, such as jts.war,
whereas Integrated Solutions Console may assign names with an
underscore, such as jts_war.

**IBM i and z/OS Restriction:** These WebSphere Application Server
Jython scripts are not supported on IBM i or z/OS operating systems.

# Automating collection of querystats and counters - examples DKGRAY Authors: Main.IanBarnard, Main.WilliamChatham Build basis: IBM Engineering Requirements Management DOORS Next 7.x. [automating-collection-of-querystats-and-counters---examples-dkgray-authors-main.ianbarnard-main.williamchatham-build-basis-ibm-engineering-requirements-management-doors-next-7.x.]

ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

When collecting must-gather information for DOORS Next, you are asked to
collect Foundation Counters as html and to start querystats collection,
then reproduce the problem, then collect counters and querystats html
pages. This information is an important part of the
[MustGather](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-doors-next-generation-performance-mustgather),
particularly for performance issues.

This page gives you some examples of how the html collection and
querystats steps might be automated using a command-line approach which
invokes curl to login and then collect the needed information.

The attached scripts are provided as as-is illustrative samples only,
i.e. without any support or warranty. You use them at your own risk.

## Background

To collect these diagnostics pages from DOORS Next you have to be
authenticated as a JazzAdmin user. It's no different if you want to
automate the page collection, which will make basically the same HTTP
GET operations as using the RM admin UI.

The examples attached to this page are for Windows (cmd) and for Linux
(bash). They both start by using curl to login, and these examples use
hard-coded credentials. You may be able to implement more secure
authentication than the methods in the script using curl.

But if you do use the scripts they authenticate as the specified user
and save the authentication cookie to a file cookies.txt which is then
used to authenticate the subsequent requests. The cookies are valid for
whatever is the authentication expiry timeout of your deployment - this
is commonly two or six hours but may have been configured differently in
your deployment. The scripts do delete cookies.txt, but again you may
want to improve this handling.

NOTE these scripts have only been tried with Form-based authentication;
they may not authenticate for deployments using JAS or other forms of
authentication.

## Pre-requisites

1\. To use the scripts attached you must have curl available - the same
sequence of operations could be implemented using a different
programmatic way of accessing your DOORS Next server, but that is
outside the scope of this article.

2\. You must enable repodebug - this has to be done manually, and can be
done once and left enabled or manually enabled/disabled around the
script run. Steps: Browse to
[https://SERVER:PORT/rm/admin](https://SERVER:PORT/rm/admin) \> Advanced
Properties, set"Enable repodebug service" to 'true' and then Save. NOTE
that restart is not required when changing this setting.

### Collection steps:

Once you have configured the scripts for your environment - in
particular the server URL, JazzAdmin user name and password, you can run
the script.

The collection scripts have the following steps:

1\. Login using hard-coded user/password to create a saved
authentication cookie

2\. Collect counters html (before) to counters_before.html

3\. Stop/reset/start querystats collection

4\. Wait for user to press a key - this is when the issue is reproduced,
then a key pressed

5\. Collect counters html (after) to counters_after.html

6\. Collect querystats html to querystats_after.html

7\. Delete the saved authentication cookie

Following this you can attach the three html files to the support case.

The example scripts are attached to htis page:

\* For Windows (cmd)

\* For Linux (bash)

### Customizing the scripts

The examples have in the first few lines some variables which must be
configured for your environment: they are for the JazzAdmin user name,
password and server URL. The examples in the script are illustrative and
are not for a publicly accessible server.

TOC{title="Page contents"}

With great power comes great responsibility. Using a supported IBM
Engineering Lifecycle Management (ELM) public API opens up many
possibilities to extend its functionality or allow new IBM Engineering
integrations. However, excessive usage of API can lead to unexpected
performance degradation, diminished user experience or frequent system
outages. There are three basic methods to cope with performance issues:

-   Rewrite your scripts,
-   Run them less frequently
-   Reduce their parallelism.

Below is the list of practices you should follow when using ELM public
APIs in custom automation:

## Put governance processes in place for custom script deployment

Deployment of custom scripts in a production deployment should be
reviewed and approved by a Change Control Board (CCB). If you do not
have CCB process in place, talk to your server administrators before
running automation against the server This allows your administrators to
be prepared and aware of potential performance impacts.

## Make your expectations reliable

Try to estimate the number of API calls or number of artifacts fetched
over time. If your estimates shows that the number of calls or artifact
fetches are too high, you should expect and plan for negative impact on
performance.

## Evaluate the functionality and performance impact on production equivalent test system first

The approach of your API requests depend strongly on result set and the
data shape of the requests and destination repository. For example, the
approach to fetch 1 attribute on 1 requirement, is very different to
fetching dozens of attributes across a project containing millions of
requirements. Therefore, before running on a production system, run it
first on a test system with production-sized data and resources.

## Start with small portion of data

If possible, try with small data set, and then extend it. For example,
you can limit your script only to one or few smaller project areas or
only for specific artifact types. If initial results are positive, and
you do not see a performance impact, extend the scope gradually.

## Consider increased load on other applications

Massive data modification from the scripts can also affect the Data
Collection Component (DCC), Lifecycle Query Engine (LQE) and Link Index
Provider (LDX) applications.

-   DCC component is used for gathering data for data warehouse reports.
    Your script can cause increased execution times of Data Collection
    jobs and storage used by your Data Warehouse database.
-   LQE and LDX applications store the data in their internal Jena
    index. Large updates of the applications increase the time needed
    for updating data sources related to an application. Reading the
    data (e.g. querying LQE for reports, fetching the backlinks from LDX
    in Engineering Workflow Management or DOORS Next applications) is
    much slower (in LQE/LDX with Jena store) when the index is being
    updated at the same time. See more recommendations on [Tips for
    administrators](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/engineering-lifecycle-management-suite/lifecycle-management/7.0.3?topic=builder-best-practices-creating-reports-report#c_best_practices_for_creating_reports_with_RB__best_prac3__title__1)

    relational
    database](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/engineering-lifecycle-management-suite/lifecycle-management/7.0.3?topic=overview-lqe-relational-store).
    Your script can impact performance of the database where the data is
    stored. More information available on [Whats new for IBM Engineering

## Use monitoring

When using custom scripts extensively, monitor your system and take
action when your CPU, memory, disk usage or thread connection pool
grows, especially if diminished user experience is observed. If
necessary, stop the script and investigate if the script is the cause of
the performance issue. Address the issue before redeploying the script.
You can find more information about monitoring in [Deployment Wiki
article](DeploymentMonitoring).

## Close the connections in your client

After reading the response from a REST API call, remember to close the
response as this can lead to holding the connection to the server open
and exhaust the web server connection pool. While code inspection can
help find connections that are not closed, monitoring the "percentage of
the web container thread pool usage" while testing will identify the
growth of open connections followed by a sudden drop when the
application holding the connections ends. Other means of validating not
closing connections would be to have a very small connection pool
configured during testing and look for an error related to not being
able to establish a connection.

## Register your custom automation as a Resource-intensive Scenario

Link to the article: [Register Custom Automation As a Resource-intensive
Scenario](CreateCustomScenarios). Display the scenario in your monitor
dashboard to diagnose whether the script is the cause or contributing
factor of the performance degradation. As a best practice use a common
pattern for the naming of the scenario, as an example include the
automation name, version and other details e.g. the command name that
the automation executes. This makes it a lot easier to understand what
is going on. Example: use a scenario name like: myautomation v2.7
exportdata

## Consider running your scripts when the system has low usage

For example, run at night or during the weekend when usage is low and
there are no maintenance activities.

## Notice, that IBM is not able to provide you with specific limits of the system

Every environment is different. Therefore it is impossible to provide
specific limits, for example: What is maximum number of artifacts you
can fetch?, or What is the memory footprint for one artifact?, or How
many calls can you make concurrently?. You have to test your specific
data on your system.

TOC{title="Page contents"}

After you start using the IBM solution for Engineering Lifecycle
Management (ELM), it will contain more and more important data.
Therefore, it is essential to make regular backups of the data to avoid
losing it. The [Rational solution for Collaborative Lifecycle Management
Information Center](https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/) contains information
on how to [back up the
databases](https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/topic/com.ibm.jazz.repository.web.admin.doc/topics/t_jfs_backup.html).
To minimize down time, you can increase the reliability of the IBM
solution for ELM by using hardware that provides high reliability.
However, failure can still happen. Since whole development teams depend
on the infrastructure, it is desirable to be able to recover it as
quickly as possible. This article provides specifics about what to
consider when backing up the IBM solution for ELM.

## Deployment topology to back up

For the purposes of this article, assume that the IBM solution for ELM
is deployed in a fully distributed topology.

-   Jazz Team Server is installed on its own server; for example,
    JTS_SERVER.
-   The Change and Configuration Management (CCM) application
    (Engineering Workflow Management) is installed on its own server:
    CCM_SERVER.
-   The Quality Management (QM) application (Engineering Test
    Management) is installed on its own server: QM_SERVER.
-   The Requirements Management (RM) application (Engineering
    Requirements Management DOORS Next) is installed on its own server:
    RM_SERVER.
-   For simplicity, assume that the installation is new and without a
    migration from prior versions. The context roots are /jts, /ccm,
    /rm, /qm.
-   Additional supporting applications such as Global Configuration
    Management, Reporting etc. may be installed. The context roots are
    /am, /gc, /rs and potentially others.
-   The databases are hosted on one or more servers.

As described in [Building products from
applications](https://jazz.net/blog/index.php/2010/08/16/building-products-from-applications/),
the IBM solution for ELM is now built around a central Jazz Team Server
and several applications that share this Jazz Team Server. In this
topic, the following abbreviations are used:

1 Jazz Team Server is referred to as JTS. 1 The Change and Configuration
Management application is referred to as the CCM application. 1 The
Quality Management application is referred to as the QM application. 1
The Requirements Management application is referred to as the RM
application. 1 Additional supporting applications may be installed and
subsumed under SUP. The assumptions above will result in a deployment
topology as shown below. Each application node has an application server
installed and the application is deployed on it. JTS, the CCM
application, and the QM application have their own own database to store
data. The RM application below Version 5.x uses JTS to store its data.
Since version 5.x RM has its own database. In the example topology, the
databases hosted on the database nodes are referred to as JTS_DB, which
are used by JTS and the RM application; CCM_DB, which is used by the CCM
application; and QM_DB, which is used by the QM application.

**Note:** Since 5.0 the RM Application has its own database RM_DB that
needs to be backed up.

Additional ELM applications such as Design Manager and Rhapsody Model
Manager require backup like any other Jazz application, if deployed.

In case a data warehouse such as Rational Reporting for Development
Intelligence or Rational Insight is set up, keep in mind that setting up
a separate backup procedure for its database and configuration data is
also needed.

## Relevant data for backup operations

This section answers the question, "What could happen?" In the topology
described above, you must plan for the following potential failure
scenarios:

1 Loss of one or more database server nodes 1 Loss of one or more
application server nodes The loss of the database server or the
application server node would each require a substitute or replacement.
In the worst case, this could mean reinstalling or reconfiguring a
machine as a replacement. You can minimize downtime also by providing
replacement systems already configured to take over as described in
[setting up a basic high
availability](https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_setting_up_ha.html)
configuration for the application server node. In any case, it is
necessary to have all required data available.

The data needed to restore a complete deployment as described above
consists of:

1 The [databases](#Backing_up_the_databases) with consistent data 1 The
[application configuration data](#Backing_up_the_Jazz_application)
created and maintained during setup and administration 1 The
[application server configuration
data](#Backing_up_the_Jazz_application) for each application server 1
The [JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files used by each
application 1 The [Fulltext index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi)
files for the CCM and QM applications 1 Any custom server extensions and
applied patches

## Practicing your backup and restore procedure

A backup procedure is worthless if data is missing, inconsistent,
unreadable, or not working for other reasons. Practice and test your
backup and restore procedure on an [isolated test
infrastructure](https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_upgrade_staging_env.html)
on a regular basis, to be sure that it works.

## Synchronizing server clocks

For normal operations as well as for backup and restore, it is important
that the clocks of your machines that run the IBM solution for ELM are
closely synchronized. The applications that require the synchronization
provide [setting up a connection to a NTP
server](https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_cluster_prerequisites.html)
to monitor the machine clocks in the advanced server properties.

## Backing up the Jazz application configuration files

While installing the products, you choose install directories. For
example, if you installed by using IBM Installation Manager on Linux,
the default server installation directory is `/opt/IBM/JazzTeamServer`.
If you installed on Windows, the default server installation directory
is `C:\Program Files(X86)\IBM\JazzTeamServer`. This installation
directory will be referred to as *server-install-dir* in the following
text. The image below shows a typical folder structure after installing
all applications on Apache Tomcat.

During the setup and configuration of Jazz Team Server and the other
applications, several files are changed either automatically or
manually. Some files that are updated during administration operations
and should therefore be included in a regular backup as well.

In this article, the backup of the Jazz application configuration files
will be represented by the following pseudocode:

`backup APP_CONFIG`

In the pseudocode, *APP*, represents the application node that must be
backed up. In the pseudocode for a specific application, *APP* must be
replaced with the acronym that represents the application, which will be
JTS, CCM, QM, RM or SUP, where SUP stands for the other applications.
This pattern is kept in the article. The pseudocode below would do the
backup for all applications:

backup SUPP_CONFIG backup CCM_CONFIG backup QM_CONFIG backup RM_CONFIG
backup JTS_CONFIG

### Files to include in the Jazz application configuration files backup

All the Jazz application configuration files are stored in one or more
folders underneath the configuration data folder:

server-install-dir/server/conf

The options for backing up the Jazz application configuration files are
a [full backup](#Full_backup) and [selective backup](#Selective_backup).

#### Full backup

You can back up the whole folder structure underneath:

server-install-dir/server/conf

for each application. This option will safely back up all data that
might be necessary to restore the Jazz application configuration. On the
other hand, it backs up more data than is actually needed.

**Note:** By default, the index files for the [JFS
index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) and the [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi) are also stored in this
location. If you use a full backup for the folder, make sure that the
backup of the index files is successful or change the server
configuration and place the index files into a location outside of the
`server-install-dir/server/conf` folder. See below for more information.

#### Selective backup

The configuration folder also contains program code which is often not
desired to be included in backups. To be more selective, it is possible
to only include the most important files and folders into the back up.
This can especially exclude all data that is installed with the product.

Each application has its own [configuration
folder](#Configuration_folder). An application can use more than one
folder. The folders must be backed up together.

JTS uses the following folders for JTS and the Lifecycle Project
Application (LPA):

server-install-dir/server/conf/jts server-install-dir/server/conf/admin

The CCM application stores its data in the folder:

server-install-dir/server/conf/ccm

The QM application stores its data in the folder:

server-install-dir/server/conf/qm

The RM application stores its data in the folder:

server-install-dir/server/conf/rm

Each application has its own configuration files as shown below:

For each application, at least back up the following files from the
configuration folder:

teamserver.properties log4j.properties

**Beginning with ELM 7.0.2 SR1 (iFix015) and ELM 7.0.1 SR1 (iFix018)** -
log4j.properties file has been changed to log4j2.xml, on those servers
you should backup the following files from the configuration folder:

teamserver.properties log4j2.xml

In general, back up all files of this format:

\*.properties

Some applications store data in RDF format. Check for files of the
following format and back them up in case there are any:

\*.rdf

Other files created during the installation are typically not modified.
If in doubt, check the modification date and time, and include files
that changed after the installation finished.

### Configuration folder

As mentioned above, if you use this as a general advice for Jazz based
solutions; for example, to back up Design Manager, or for newer versions
of the tool, back up all of the relevant data in all available
configuration folders in:

server-install-dir/server/conf

Like JTS, Design Manager uses more than one configuration folder; in
this particular case, `dm` and `vvc`. Be sure to catch all relevant data
from these folders. Other applications add their own folders here. For
example

1 `am` - Rhapsody Model Manager 1 `dcc` - Data Collection Component 1
`gc` - Global Configuration Management application 1 `ldx` - Link
Indexer; see the documentation about backing up the data 1 `lqe` -
Lifecycle Query Engine; See the documentation about backing up the data
1 `relm` - Engineering Lifecycle Manager 1 `rs` - Jazz Reporting Service

All these applications behave in similar ways and have configuration and
potentially other data such as their own database to back up. JRS also
provides a mechanism to export the custom reports.

Do not add any folders to the server-install-dir/server/conf folder.
Especially do not create copies of the existing folders and store them
in this folder. This will cause issues with your application; for
example, if you run setup again in an upgrade scenario.

#### Backing up custom server extensions

A [full backup](#Full_backup) contains all the required data. If you
deployed any custom server extensions, and do a [selective
backup](#Selective_backup), either back up the corresponding files or at
least have the files available for rapid redeployment. The files that
are needed to deploy custom server extensions are typically stored in
the folder:

server-install-dir/server/conf/APP/provision_profiles

The files that must be backed up are the provision profile `.ini` file
and the corresponding update `site` folder.

#### Backing up the deployed patches

A [full backup](#Full_backup) contains all the required data. If you
deployed any patches, and do a [selective backup](#Selective_backup),
either back up the corresponding files or at least have the files
available for rapid redeployment. See the patch description for the
files that need to be included in a backup.

## Backing up the application server configuration

Back up the application server configuration data for all application
servers, in order to be able to restore it later. How to back up this
data and which data needs to be included in the backup depends on the
application server in use. The application server configuration changes
only due to administrative tasks. It should be sufficient to use an
incremental backup once a day.

Backing up the application server configuration files for the *APP*
application will be be represented below by the following pseudocode:

backup APP_APPSERVER_CONFIG

The following pseudocode shows the steps to back up all application
server configuration files for all nodes:

backup SUPP_APPSERVER_CONFIG backup CCM_APPSERVER_CONFIG backup
QM_APPSERVER_CONFIG backup RM_APPSERVER_CONFIG backup
JTS_APPSERVER_CONFIG

### Tomcat

When installing on Tomcat, the application server configuration data is
in server-install-dir/server/tomcat/conf/. Some of these files are
modified during the setup process and during operation and should be
included in the backup procedure.

The following files are typically modified during the setup and should
be backed up:

server-install-dir/server/tomcat/conf/server.xml
server-install-dir/server/tomcat/conf/web.xml

If you provide a server certificate, include it in your backup. You can
find information about the storage location of the used certificate in
the `server.xml` file. The Connector element contains a keystoreFile
property that contains the file location.

If you edited the application's `web.xml` files; for instance, when
using Tomcat with LDAP, include these files in your backup. The
`web.xml` files to backup are stored in this location:

server-install-dir/server/tomcat/webapps/APP/WEB-INF/web.xml

For example:

server-install-dir/server/tomcat/webapps/jts/WEB-INF/web.xml
server-install-dir/server/tomcat/webapps/ccm/WEB-INF/web.xml

If you are using Tomcat for user authorization, also back up the user
registry file:

server-install-dir/server/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml

### WebSphere Application Server

When using WebSphere Application Server, back up the profile used to
deploy the application. See the [WebSphere Application Server Knowledge
Center](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP/mapfiles/product_welcome_was.html)
for your version of the WebSphere Application Server for more
information. One option is to use the
[manageprofiles](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.installation.base.doc/ae/rxml_manageprofiles.html)
command.

### WebSphere Liberty

As of 6.0, WebSphere Liberty replaced Tomcat as the application server
packaged out of the box with CLM.

When installing on WebSphere Liberty, the application server
configuration data is in these folders
server-install-dir/server/liberty/servers/clm/
server-install-dir/server/liberty/servers/clm/conf/

Some of the files underneath these folders are modified during the setup
process and during operation and should be included in the backup
procedure.

The following files are typically modified during the setup and should
be backed up:

server-install-dir/server/liberty/servers/clm/server.xml
server-install-dir/server/liberty/servers/clm/conf/ldapUserRegistry.xml
server-install-dir/server/liberty/servers/clm/conf/application.xml

If you are using the built in local user authorization, also back up the
user registry file:

server-install-dir/server/liberty/servers/clm/conf/basicUserRegistry.xml

If you provide a server certificate, include it in your backup. You can
find information about the storage location of the used certificate in
the `server.xml` file. The element keyStore contains a location property
that contains the file location. If this shows a file or a relative path
the default location for the file is in

server-install-dir/server/liberty/servers/clm/conf/resources/security/

## Backing up the databases

It is necessary to backup all databases used by the applications. The RM
application since version 5.0 has its own database. In versions before
5.0 RM used the JTS database to store its data and therefore did not
have a separate database to back up. If you use a data warehouse, also
set up a backup procedure for its database.

Backing up the application database for the *APP* application will be be
represented below by the following pseudocode:

backup APP_DB

The pseudocode below represents all steps and the sequence needed to
back up for all databases for all applications:

backup SUP_DBs backup CCM_DB backup QM_DB backup RM_DB backup JTS_DB

### Ensuring a consistent database backup

When backing up a database, make sure that the database backup is
complete and consistent from a transaction perspective. A backup is
consistent if taken offline, while the database is inactive, or when it
is locked for write operations. Some enterprise databases allow
consistent online backups with transaction logging or vendor specific
procedures and tools.

There are several databases to back up and the applications interact.
JTS creates elements in the registered applications. The JTS cannot
create an element if it is already there because the database of the
registered application is ahead of the JTS. To avoid conflicts and
ensure consistency, the databases for all registered applications must
be backed up to a point in time equal or earlier than the JTS database.
In the example topology, this holds for the CCM and the QM databases.
This has an [impact on the database restore
operation](https://jazz.net/library/article/795#Temporal_Database_Consistency_During),
especially for online backups.

### Derby databases

If a Derby database is used, the application server must be shut down to
perform the database backup.

To back up the databases, compress and back up the directory and its
content used by Derby as repository. By default, the directory is called
repositoryDB. The default location for this directory is the `derby`
folder in the configuration folder of each application:

server-install-dir/server/conf/ccm/derby/repositoryDB
server-install-dir/server/conf/qm/derby/repositoryDB
server-install-dir/server/conf/rm/derby/repositoryDB
server-install-dir/server/conf/jts/derby/repositoryDB

Verify the location of your setup by checking the
`com.ibm.team.repository.db.jdbc.location` property in the
`teamserver.properties` file of each application.

### Enterprise databases

See the system requirements on the **Getting Started** tab of the
individual product download page for the supported database management
systems. Also see the [information
center](https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/) and the
[library](https://jazz.net/library/) for information about how to backup
other databases. For detailed information on how to backup your
database, see the documentation for the database management system you
are using.

In general, the options provided by enterprise database management
systems are:

#### Offline backup

It is always possible to do an offline backup. Before you back up the
database, stop the application server so that no user interaction occurs
during the backup. This ensures the backup is consistent. You can also
consistently back up all other data related to the server while it is
shut down.

#### Online backup

Some database management systems, such as DB2, support online backup.
This can be used to continuously back up the databases. For more details
about DB2 online backup, see [this
article](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/OnlineBackupCLMDB2).

If using online backup, you still want to back up the [Jazz application
configuration files](#Backing_up_the_Jazz_application) as well as the
[application server configuration
files](#Backing_up_the_application_serve). You will most likely not be
able to back up and restore the configuration files consistently with
the online backup. However, these files are only changed when
configuring the application server or administrating the capabilities of
the server configuration. Back up these files after performing any of
these tasks. Otherwise you must redo changes that did not make it into
the last backup.

You also must have a consistent backup of the [JFS
index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) and the [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi) files. Since version 4.0.5 the
[JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) provides a capability to
back up the work item index along withe the [JFS
index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files). See [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi) for considerations, especially
for online backup. For backing up DNG indices, see [Backup and
restoration of Jazz Foundation Service index files for Rational DOORS
Next
Generation](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/DngJfsIndexBackup)

If a consistent online backup of the work index is the primary concern,
A complete offline backup is still the preferred option to get a fully
consistent backup of the databases and the other files.

## Backing up the JFS index files

The applications use [JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files
for various query and search operations. These files must be backed up.
The [JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files can be backed up
independent from the database. See [Query, Search and indexing
technologies in CLM](DeploymentJazzIndicesTechnology) and [Indices
storage and management: Backup, recovery and
recreation](DeploymentJazzIndicesStorage) for more information on the
indexes.

### Ensuring a consistent backup of database and index files

To create a consistent backup of the [JFS
index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files and restore from it, back
up the [JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files before or
during the backup of the database. The indexing service will re-create
index information for database content not found in the index over time.
Backing up the indexes will be be represented below by the following
pseudocode:

backup APP_JFSINDEXES

In the pseudocode above, *APP* represents the application node that must
backed up. The following code backs up all nodes:

backup CCM_JFSINDEXES backup QM_JFSINDEXES backup RM_JFSINDEXES backup
JTS_JFSINDEXES

**Note:** Up to version 5.0 the RM application did not have its own [JFS
index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files and these indexes where
maintained by JTS.

### JFS index file locations

The location of the [JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files
can be found in the `teamserver.properties` file for each application as
value of the following properties:

com.ibm.team.jfs.index.root.directory

The location of the index files is, by default, relative to the folder
where the `teamserver.properties` file is located. This should be
changed to an absolute path.

### Backup of the JFS index files in version 3.x products

To avoid a corrupted backup of the [JFS
index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files in **3.x products**, stop
the indexing service during the backup period or shut down the server.
Stopping the indexing services can increase the server up time when
running backups. It is necessary to resume the indexing services after
the backup has been performed.

The indexing service can be stopped by using the -suspendIndexer
repotools command:

repotools-APP -suspendIndexer APP_PARAMETER

The indexing service can be restarted by using the -resumeIndexer
repotools command:

repotools-APP -resumeIndexer APP_PARAMETER

In the above pseudocode, repotools-APP needs to be replaced by the
repotools command for the application that is backed up. For example,
`repotools-ccm` for the CCM application. In addition, APP_PARAMETER
represents the required parameters for the command, such as the
repository URL of the server and the login information for an
administrative user. For the syntax and options, see the repotools
command help. As an example for JTS, the command looks like this:

repotools-jts -suspendIndexer
repositoryURL=[https://JTS_SERVER:JTS_SERVER_PORT/jts](https://JTS_SERVER:JTS_SERVER_PORT/jts)
adminUserID=\*\*\***\*** adminPassword=\*\*\***\***

For simplicity, this article uses the pseudocode below to describe the
detailed [JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) backup for the
*APP* node:

suspendIndexing APP_SERVER backup APP_JFSINDEXES resumeIndexing
APP_SERVER

The following code shows the detailed pseudocode for all nodes:

suspendIndexing CCM_SERVER backup CCM_JFSINDEXES resumeIndexing
CCM_SERVER

suspendIndexing QM_SERVER backup QM_JFSINDEXES resumeIndexing QM_SERVER

### Backing up the JFS index files in 4.0 - 4.0.4

In version 4.0, a new repotools command was introduced that does the
backup of the [JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files for an
application, with the server online.

Backing up the [JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) in version
4.0. and later is described by using the same pseudocode:

backup APP_JFSINDEXES

Where repotools-APP must be replaced by the repotools command for the
application that is backed up. For example, `repotools-ccm` for the CCM
application. In addition, APP_PARAMETER represents the required
parameters for the command, such as the repository URL of the server and
the login information for an administrative user. For the syntax and
options, see the repotools command help. As an example for JTS, the
command looks like this:

repotools-jts -backupJFSIndexes
repositoryURL=[https://JTS_SERVER:JTS_SERVER_PORT/jts](https://JTS_SERVER:JTS_SERVER_PORT/jts)
adminUserID=\*\*\***\*** adminPassword=\*\*\***\***
toFile=FILELOCATION_AND_NAME

Using this command maintains the consistency of the [JFS
index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files and does not require to
stop and restart the indexer.

**Note:** In versions before 4.0.5 the defect [Defect
245648](https://jazz.net/jazz/web/projects/Jazz20Foundation#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=245648)
prevents from suspending indexing the [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi). In these versions it is
necessary to do a consistent backup of these indexes, while the server
is running.

### Backing up the JFS index files in 4.0.5 and later

Since version 4.0.5 the [JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files)
provides a capability to back up the work item index along with the [JFS
index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files). See [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi) for considerations, especially
for online backup.

## Backing up the Fulltext index files

Some applications, such as CCM and QM, also use a [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi) to support various search and
query operations. You must back up the [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi) files to be able to restore
the applications consistently. The [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi) cannot be backed up
independent of the database.

Backing up the indexes is represented by the following pseudocode:

backup APP_FULLTEXTINDEX

In the pseudocode above, *APP* represents the application node that
needs to be backed up. The code below backs up all nodes. JTS does not
have a [Fulltext index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi):

backup CCM_FULLTEXTINDEX backup QM_FULLTEXTINDEX

### Ensuring a consistent backup of database and Fulltext index

Beginning with version 4.0.5 the work item index backup is now included
in the back up of the [JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files).

However, the work item index is still built up during work item
operations. If restored from an online backup of the [JFS
index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files), it does not index operations
that are not included in the backup. So other than the rest of the [JFS
index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files, the work item index does
not catch up with later changes and will remain inconsistent with later
work item operations. RED Note as of 5.0.1, the fulltext work item index
does catch up with the database similarly to how the JFS indices
catching up. ENDCOLOR

To get a consistent backup of the work item index files a recreation of
the index might still be necessary. If a consistent online backup of the
work index is the primary concern, a complete offline backup should then
be performed in order to get a fully consistent backup of the databases
and the other files.

### Fulltext index file locations

The location of the [Fulltext index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi)
files can be found in the `teamserver.properties` file for each
application as value of the following properties:

com.ibm.team.fulltext.indexLocation

The location of the [Fulltext index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi)
files is, by default a relative path. It will be based on the
application relative runtime location. If your CLM application is
running on Tomcat this will be the same as the application configuration
directory; if your CLM application is running on WebSphere Application
Server, this will be the profile path, for example: //profiles/AppSrv01/

This should be changed to an absolute path.

## Other Considerations

### Export the reports from Report Service

You can export the reports from the report service and also import them
in a different system. This is especially interesting when using backup
and restore as a means to create test systems.

### CCM Cluster

In a CCM clustered configuration backup the database and at least one of
the cluster nodes with the configuration and index data. To restore use
that node as template to create additional nodes.

### Other systems that might need backup

Check your topology to determine if there are additional systems that
need to be backed up such as **Jazz Authorization Server**, **Reverse
Proxies**, **Caching Proxies** and other applications that play a role
in your setup. All these might contain configuration data that could be
important to be backed up.

## Backup scenarios

With all relevant backup operations described above, it is now possible
to look at different scenarios and provide the sequence of backup
operations.

### Offline backup

#### Shutting down and starting up ELM

If you shut down an ELM environment that uses multiple distributed
servers, make sure to

-   Start up JTS first
-   Shutdown JTS last

You can start up and shut down the other applications in any order, if
you make sure the JTS is handled as described above.

#### Offline backup sequence for a single application on a single server

A complete offline backup procedure for one application on a single
server machine would perform the following sequence of activities:

shutdown \${APP}\_SERVER backup \${APP}\_CONFIG backup
\${APP}\_SERVER_CONFIG backup \${APP}\_JFSINDEXES backup
\${APP}\_FULLTEXTINDEX backup \${APP}\_DB startup \${APP}\_SERVER

Offline backup is the easiest, safest option and easiest to implement
option for co-located and distributed topologies.

**Note:** Since version 5.0 The RM application does require backing up
of the index files or the database. In versions before this was done
with the JTS backup

#### Offline backup sequence for the IBM solution for ELM

A full offline backup for all nodes could look like this example:

shutdown CCM_SERVER shutdown QM_SERVER shutdown RM_SERVER shutdown
JTS_SERVER

backup CCM_CONFIG backup QM_CONFIG backup RM_CONFIG backup JTS_CONFIG

backup CCM_SERVER_CONFIG backup QM_SERVER_CONFIG backup RM_SERVER_CONFIG
backup JTS_SERVER_CONFIG

backup CCM_JFSINDEXES backup QM_JFSINDEXES backup RM_JFSINDEXES backup
JTS_JFSINDEXES

backup CCM_FULLTEXTINDEX backup QM_FULLTEXTINDEX

backup CCM_DB backup QM_DB backup RM_DB backup JTS_DB

startup JTS-server startup CCM-server startup QM-server startup
RM-server

In the scenario above the backup of the [JFS
index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files assumes suspending the
indexer in 3.x and using the backupJFSIndexes command in 4.x. During
startup in a distributed environment, start JTS first, then start the
other servers.

#### Offline backup with reduced server downtime

The example above has the longest downtime for offline backup scenarios.
There are several options to reduce downtime, dependent on the systems
and infrastructure in use. These include:

-   Backing up the application configuration files while the server is
    up
-   Backing up the application server configuration while the server is
    up
-   Stopping indexing for backing up the [JFS
    index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) and keeping the server
    operational during the backup
-   Isolating the server from users while backing up the database
-   Online backup of the database

The following example only takes the server offline to backup the
databases and the [Fulltext index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi)
files:

backup CCM_CONFIG backup QM_CONFIG backup RM_CONFIG backup JTS_CONFIG

backup CCM_SERVER_CONFIG backup QM_SERVER_CONFIG backup RM_SERVER_CONFIG
backup JTS_SERVER_CONFIG

backup CCM_JFSINDEXES backup QM_JFSINDEXES backup RM_JFSINDEXES backup
JTS_JFSINDEXES

shutdown CCM-server shutdown QM-server shutdown RM-server shutdown
JTS-server

backup CCM_FULLTEXTINDEX backup QM_FULLTEXTINDEX

backup CCM_DB backup QM_DB backup RM_DB backup JTS_DB

startup JTS-server startup CCM-server startup QM-server startup
RM-server

### Online backup

As of 5.0.1, a continuous online backup is possible which means both the
[JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) and [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi) files can be backed up online.
However, for versions prior to 5.0.1, it is necessary to take the server
offline at least to back up the [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi). In that case, to restore from
an online backup without a consistent backup of the [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi), you must re-create the
[Fulltext index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi) files from the
restored databases.

## Restoring from a backup

Replace backup by restore in the pseudocode to get a restore strategy.

### Temporal database consistency during a restore

Keep a valid temporal sequence of the database states during backup and
restore. Make sure to restore the databases for all applications
registered to a JTS; for example, the CCM and the QM database, from a
point in time shortly before or equal to the JTS database backup last
transaction. This is especially important for using online backup for
the database, but also holds for offline backup. In offline backups, you
can create a consistent backup if all servers are down at the same time.
This requirement is due to the JTS creating elements in the registered
applications and potential conflicts in case the database of the
registered application is ahead of the JTS database.

When restoring the [JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files
from a backup, make sure that the time of the backup of the index files
is from before the application's database backup. If you restore a
backup of the [JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files that is
more recent than the backup of the database of that application, error
messages will indicate that the index is ahead of the database. In this
case, you must re-create the index files.

You also must restore a backup of the [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi) files that is consistent with
the databases or you must re-create the [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi). A complete restore procedure
will perform the following sequence of activities:

restore CCM_CONFIG restore QM_CONFIG restore RM_CONFIG restore
JTS_CONFIG

restore CCM_SERVER_CONFIG restore QM_SERVER_CONFIG restore
RM_SERVER_CONFIG restore JTS_SERVER_CONFIG

restore CCM_JFSINDEXES restore QM_JFSINDEXES restore RM_JFSINDEXES
restore JTS_JFSINDEXES

restore CCM_FULLTEXTINDEX restore QM_FULLTEXTINDEX

restore CCM_DB restore QM_DB restore RM_DB restore JTS_DB

### Complex scenarios

Since CLM 2011, you can install more than one CCM and QM application on
different servers and run them against a common JTS. In that case, you
must add these additional servers to the backup and perform all backup
steps for each individual server. It is necessary to keep the temporal
consistency for the JTS and all the applications registered to it. If
you use more than one JTS, there is no requirement to keep the temporal
consistency between the different groups of JTS and its registered
applications.

### Summary

This article described the data and steps required to back up a
deployment of the IBM solution for ELM. The article provides several
options for backing up and also provides information about how to back
up more complex Jazz deployments.

## Appendix

### Backing up applications that were upgraded from a release of version 2

In the case of an installation that was upgraded to a version of the 3.0
release, the upgraded applications use the `/jazz` path instead of
`/ccm` or `/qm`. Therefore, all occurrences of these strings in this
article must be replaced with `/jazz`.

### Re-creating the index files

You can re-create the index files from a restored database backup. Be
aware that re-creation of the index files is an expensive operation and
must performed with the server shut down.

#### Recreating the Fulltext index

You can re-create the [Fulltext
index](#Backing_up_the_Fulltext_index_fi) files by using this command:

repotools-APP -rebuildTextIndices

#### Re-creating the JFS index

You can re-create the [JFS index](#Backing_up_the_JFS_index_files) files
by using this command:

repotools-APP -reindex all

### Oracle backups

See [this
technote](https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21454793)
about Oracle backup, especially if you intend to use datapump.

There is a known issue with Oracle databases that are restored from a
backup in 3.0.x. For details, see [work item
180771](https://jazz.net/jazz/web/projects/Jazz20Foundation#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=180771).
If this issue occurs, Support can provide a solution.

### Backing up products that were upgraded from a release of version 2

In the case of an installation that was upgraded from a release of
version 2, the context root will be `jazz` instead of `ccm` or `qm`. In
these cases, all occurrences of the context root in the URLs and paths
above must be replaced with `jazz`.

# Why is browser performance slow? [why-is-browser-performance-slow]

DKGRAY Authors: Main.StephanieBagot Build basis: CLM 4.x and later
ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

This page will help determine why there is performance degradation
within the web UI of IBM Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management
(CLM) applications.

## Why does performance vary between browsers?

The performance of the browser's JavaScript engine has a direct impact
on the perceived end-user performance in web applications. The entire
Rational Team Concert web UI is run in JavaScript (except some Flash
reports), so the browser must load the dojo toolkit plus thousands of
JavaScript classes. The JavaScript engine must parse and execute this
information. Most browser vendors and versions have different JavaScript
engines, each with different abilities to interpret and run the
JavaScript, thus resulting in varying browser performance when loading
the CLM applications. Therefore, excluding network latency and
relatively short server response times, the performance of the CLM web
UI is directly proportional to the browser JavaScript engine speed.

Many resources are available online that provide browser comparisons
like the following article: (NOTE: this link will take you to an
external page) [The Big Browser Benchmark
Test](http://www.zdnet.com/the-big-browser-benchmark-all-the-latest-browsers-tested-7000007401/).

## Browser performance with CLM applications

The CLM web UI is optimized to improve performance in the code, by
compressing and pre-processing the JavaScript to be optimized, but the
web UI performance is still restricted based on the JavaScript engine
capabilities.

Based on our experience, the performance of Mozilla Firefox or Google
Chrome when running CLM applications can be significantly better than
the performance of Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Some performance testing has been done against 3.x and 4.x and can be
viewed under [WAN Performance
Testing](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/Jazz_wan_perf_40). Some
additional example measurements from our tests with CLM 4.0.1 are
provided below. These tests were gathered using a combination of
[HTTPWatch](http://www.httpwatch.com/) (Firefox and Internet Explorer)
and [Speed
Tracer](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/speedtracer/)
(Chrome).

**NOTE:** The measurements provided should not be used as a baseline for
browser performance in your environment. Your results might vary based
on your environment: hardware, operating system, other running software,
network, application server, database, authentication mechanism you use,
etc. All measurements are in seconds. Below is an average sample of
loading times gathered between different browsers using a small set of
functionality within Rational Team Concert. In order to validate this
information in your environment, see the section below to determine how
to run the comparative tests in your environment.

| Scenario | Internet Explorer 8 | Firefox 19 | Chrome 26 |
|:---|---:|:---|:---|
| Login without project area specified | 3.93 | 3.70 | 3.60 |
| Loading small work item | 9.27 | 5.30 | 4.54 |

## Possible causes

There are generally two causes for slow browser performance:

**1. User browser related issue** Performance from the web UI can be
cause by the browser JavaScript engine as discussed above

**2. Server performance issue** When overall browser performance is:

-   reported by all users
-   happens consistently at a certain time

The slow browser performance might be caused by a server-related issue
such as network latency, database response time etc. This type of
performance degradation will also be viewed in a rich client such as
Eclipse. For this type of performance issue, navigate to [How to Start a
Troubleshooting
Assessment](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/HowToStartATroubleshootingAssessment)
to identify possible causes to further investigate. Various performance
situations will be discussed on the [Performance
Troubleshooting](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/PerformanceTroubleshooting)
page.

## Recommended analysis steps

If you have experienced browser performance issues, navigate to [Browser
Performance](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/BrowserPerformance)
to determine if the issue is related to the server/client configuration,
or the actual browser itself.

### Questions to identify the problem

1 What URLs are being accessed? (Are you going through a proxy or
directly to the CLM server?) 1 Are the browsers being run on the same
LAN as the CLM server? If not, keep in mind that the location of your
user may cause some latency 1 When does the performance degradation
occur? (At peak hours or when there is a light user load?)

### Analysis steps

To investigate and analyze the performance degradation from within a
browser, take the following steps:

-   Ensure that the browser cache is clean before running any browser
    tests for performance

<!-- -->

-   Open your process monitor and see how much memory or CPU usage your
    browser is taking. On the machine running the client browser, take a
    look at the memory utilization to determine if your browser is
    running as 'lean' as possible. Closing down tabs or the entire
    browser itself and restarting it might release some of the consumed
    memory if it is too high.

<!-- -->

-   Deploy the Performance Health Check Dashboard widget [The
    Performance Health Check Dashboard
    widget](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/PerformanceHealthCheckWidget)
    runs a number of tests to measure the performance of various systems
    in a CLM deployment including the client, application server and
    database server. If the widget displays reasonable response times
    for each of the tests (green), then the latency and throughput of
    your connection with the server is within reasonable times and is
    indicative of a healthy server. Looking at the two possible causes
    above, browser or server, green response times rule out server as a
    root cause for performance degradation, leaving the browser as a
    possible culprit for the slow loading times. Alternatively, if the
    tests display red or slow response times, this shows that the
    connection with the server is not strong, leading to overall server
    performance (and not the specific browser) as the root cause. If
    this is the case, navigate back to the [Performance
    Troubleshooting](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/PerformanceTroubleshooting)
    main page to begin investigating other possible causes for the slow
    performance.

<!-- -->

-   Execute a comparative browser test In analyzing browser performance
    issues, it is important to determine if the product is causing the
    performance degradation, or the browser itself based on the
    limitations of the JavaScript engine as noted above. Running a
    comparative browser test will help identify if browser A is causing
    the problem, since the same function is displaying better
    performance in browser B. [HTTPWatch](http://www.httpwatch.com/) is
    a useful tool to inspect and monitor CSS, HTML, JavaScript and
    Internet requests in any web page and can help when investigating
    browser-related performance issues. To learn how to use HTTPWatch in
    your analysis, navigate to [How to Use
    HTTPWatch](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/HowToHTTPWatch).
    Another useful tool is the
    \[\[<http://www.webkit.org/perf/sunspider/sunspider.html>\]\[SunSpider
    JavaScript Benchmark\] webkit, which will compare the overall
    browser performance related to the JavaScript engine for the core
    JavaScript language only (not touching on DOM or browser APIs).
    Using the tools mentioned above, or others such as
    [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/), or
    [SpeedTracer](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/speedtracer/),
    will trace the actual calls being made when loading a page within
    CLM. This information can be compared for varying performance across
    browsers (various browser add-ons might be needed for different
    vendors). See [How to Use
    HTTPWatch](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/HowToHTTPWatch)
    for more instructions on using the tool.

## Possible solutions

If the browser performance degradation is identified to be a **browser
issue**, then: Test the performance using a new browser (same vendor
with different version or different vendor all together) to determine if
the behavior is the same.

-   For example, if using Internet Explorer, try testing in Firefox or
    Chrome, as long as the browser is a [supported
    version](https://jazz.net/library/article/1109). If you are unable
    to test using a different browser, try to test using a different
    *version* of the browser, such as Internet Explorer 8 or 9. In our
    experience, Firefox and Chrome have increased performance over
    Internet Explorer.
-   If using a different browser did not result in increased
    performance, navigate back to the [Performance
    Troubleshooting](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/PerformanceTroubleshooting)
    main page to begin investigation into other possible causes for the
    slow performance and perhaps look into tuning the overall server for
    better performance.

If the browser performance degradation was actually identified to be a
**server issue**, then navigate to [Performance
Troubleshooting](PerformanceTroubleshooting) for additional topics on
troubleshooting and tuning.

### Tips to making Internet browsers run faster

-   Keep your browser up-to-date and patched
-   Make sure any plug-ins or extensions are up-to-date and patched
-   Remove any plug-ins or extensions you do not use
-   Think twice before customizing your browser
-   Run as lean as possible (no customizations, don't open multiple
    tabs)
-   Ensure you keep the cache for any CLM application information as it
    will speed up the loading time of the web UI
-   Cookies will maintain your authentication, but can be deleted after
    your user session to keep your browser lean. Keep in mind that
    removing the cookies will also remove the saved username from the
    login splash screen (if you have it selected).

# Optimizing browsers to search within the Deployment wiki [optimizing-browsers-to-search-within-the-deployment-wiki]

DKGRAY Authors: Main.GrantCovell ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

This page describes how to optimize different browsers to search within
the Deployment wiki.

## Google Chrome

The Google Chrome browser permits adding keywords in the address bar or
omnibox to facilitate searches at specific sites using the sites' own
search engines.

To enable this for the Deployment wiki, navigate to Settings \> Search
\> Manage search engines... In the "Other search engines" section where
the empty boxes show "Add a new search engine", enter "Jazz.net
Deployment wiki" in the first field, "deploy" in the second field, and
"<https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/WebSearch?search=s&scope=text>"
in the third field.

Now you can search directly on the Deployment wiki site from within the
Google Chrome address bar or omnibox. Type "deploy" (or the keyword you
chose in the step above), and then a space, and then the search terms
you are looking for.

(These instructions were validated in version 27.0.1453.110 m.)

## Mozilla Firefox

The Mozilla Firefox browser permits adding keywords in the address bar
to facilitate searches at specific sites using the sites' own search
engines.

To enable this for the Deployment wiki, navigate to the Deployment wiki
Web Search page <https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/WebSearch>.
In the search field, right-click to show the "Add a Keyword for this
Search..." dialog box and, in the Keyword field, enter "deploy".

Now you can search directly on the Deployment wiki site from within the
Mozilla Firefox address bar. Type "deploy" (or the keyword you chose in
the step above) then a space and then the search terms you are looking
for.

(These instructions were validated in version 17.0.6.)

### Mozilla Firefox search engine plugin

We created a Search Engine for Firefox which must be manually installed
in your Firefox installation. The file is attached to this page and can
be downloaded from the attachments section below. Copy the file to your
computer and put it into the Firefox search engine plugin folder. The
location for Firefox search engines varies (and may change over time),
but the approximate location is:

\\searchplugins

for example, on Windows:

C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\\default\searchplugins

## Microsoft Internet Explorer

*Even though the search provider capability is XML based, it is not
apparent how to enable it for Internet Explorer without running a script
or editing a registry key. At this point, if you want to add an Internet
Explorer search provider, you need to find a site online that can
configure and run the script for you in your browser. The Deployment
wiki community is still looking into ways to activate this functionality
non-intrusively.*

# Why does the Rational Team Concert client take a long time to connect to the build agent server? [why-does-the-rational-team-concert-client-take-a-long-time-to-connect-to-the-build-agent-server]

DKGRAY Authors: IntegrationsTroubleshootingTeam Build basis: Rational
Team Concert 4.x and later ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

When running BuildLoopTask or "Test Connection" from a Rational Team
Concert (RTC) client to connect to the build agents server, the process
to get connected to the build server is slow.

## Initial assessment

### Symptoms

-   When you click **Test Connection** under defined build engine in the
    RTC Eclipse client, it takes 10 seconds or more for the results to
    come as a pass.

### Impact/scope

-   This can also contribute to build requests staying in a pending
    state for longer.

## Data gathering and subsequent analysis steps

-   A third party tool can be used to debug this problem
    ([Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/))
-   Run Wireshark on the build agent machine and the RTC server machine
    and capture the interfaces that are being used by both machines.
-   Run the "Test Connection" from the RTC client.
-   Now the network communication between the RTC server and the build
    agent machine will be captured in Wireshark along with other network
    communication happening on those machines.
-   Look for the TCP communication that is done from the RTC server
    machine to the build server machine.
-   Use Wireshark filter \*ip.dst == \* on the capture of the build
    machine to filter out unnecessary traces
-   Follow the TCP stream of the RTC server and build machine in
    Wireshark.
-   Check all the communication ASCII output.
-   Look for any other errors reported while checking the source and
    destination IP address in Wireshark.

## Possible causes

-   Following the TCP stream using Wireshark might show the cause of the
    delay in some cases. The long delay to pass the connection test
    might be caused by map drives on the build agent machines that were
    not resolved. Example:

200 HELLO - BuildForge Agent v7.1.2.2-0-0010 cmd ping

# Calculating your requirements metrics DKGRAY Authors: Main.PaulEllis, Main.BrianSteele, Main.ErikCraig, Main.BenjaminSilverman, Main.MartinHenderson Build basis: DOORS 9, Rational DOORS Next Generation 4, 5, 6. [calculating-your-requirements-metrics-dkgray-authors-main.paulellis-main.briansteele-main.erikcraig-main.benjaminsilverman-main.martinhenderson-build-basis-doors-9-rational-doors-next-generation-4-5-6.]

When discussing the planning of deployment topologies appropriate for
your requirements management system, it is important to understand your
existing system. Below details how you would calculate these numbers in
order to help you decide on how to deploy your servers. This topic is
tightly integrated with [planning for multiple requirements management
instances](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/PlanForMultipleJazzAppInstances#Multiple_Requirements_Management)
and the [sizing
strategies](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/CLMSizingStrategy60)
which are intended to be used to calculate the maximum sizes of each
instance. In November 2015, [a white
paper](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/rational-migrate-doors-data-to-doors-next-generation-trs/index.html?cm_mc_uid=36410414050514450077320&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1455104530)
was published on how to migrate data from Rational DOORS to Rational
DOORS Next Generation. This should be studied alongside this page,
indeed, this page is supplementary information on how to derive your
existing data shape when approaching a migration.

**Note:** The architecture of DOORS Next 7.x no longer uses the [Apache
Jena TDB](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/tdb/), so this article
is no longer relevant once you migrate to that release.

## Using Migration Metrics with Rational DOORS 9

As documented in [the developerWorks
article](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/rational-migrate-doors-data-to-doors-next-generation-trs/index.html?cm_mc_uid=36410414050514450077320&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1455104530),
the DOORS migration metrics utility is used to perform harmonization and
consolidation of types. Reports of attributes and enumerations are
examined and those that are similar or vary only by case of name must be
identified and classified as intentional or in need of harmonization.
Our needs at this point though are purely to derive the outlines of the
data shape in terms of numbers of requirements objects.

To achieve this, then simply download the DOORS 9.6.1.3 (or later)
client and install this on a machine which doesn't currently have a
DOORS 9 client. This restriction is due to DOORS 9 only supporting one
client per machine. If you only have access to one machine, then you can
uninstall your existing client and then reinstall after completing this
procedure.

There are further options available within the Migration Metrics with
later releases of DOORS 9, so it is advisable to download the latest to
avail of the latest possibilities. See [Gathering migration
metrics](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYQBZ_9.6.1/com.ibm.doors.administering.doc/topics/t_get_module_metrics.html?lang=en-us)
for the latest and complete instructions if desired.

Use the Migration Metrics utility in IBM Rational DOORS to gather
information on whole projects or selected modules within a project. In
the DOORS 9.6.1.3 client select:

1.  Select a project in the database explorer. 2. Click **File \>
    Migration \> Migration Metrics.** 3. In the Migration Metrics
    window, select the project and scope, including the entire project
    or selected modules. 4. Click Go to create the migration metrics
    output

Note: The Migration Metrics utility is not for an entire DOORS database.
This allows analysis per project or per sub-partition which in turn
allows you to size the migration into Rational DOORS Next Generation
more easily. This page though is not intended to discuss the migration
process in detail, merely how you would count your requirements metrics.

## Using SPARQL queries to obtain your metrics from DOORS Next Generation

Firstly, before running these queries please note that some of these may
take some time to complete. Whilst they will not interfere too much with
your production service, it is recommended that you run these during
quieter periods where few users are likely to compete for query
resources. Where repositories are large, then these queries could take
10 minutes. Therefore warnings of queries exceeding 45-second limits may
be recorded in the rm.log.

To identify the number of artifacts within a specific project you can
run a SPARQL query. SPARQL queries can be executed on the RDNG built-in
administration panel `https://:/rm/rmadmin`, Under Debug \> SPARQL
Query. Alternatively, you can go immediately to
<https://:/rm/admin#action=com.ibm.rdm.fronting.server.web.debugQuery>

In the query window, set the custom SPARQL query scope to the project
and check pre-count. Run the following query

Under the results column, you would see `1/xxxxx` where `xxxxx` is the
number of resources in the project the query is being run against.

To determine the number of links replace `rm:Artifact` with `rm:Link` in
the above query.

### SPARQL query to count number of artifacts in your repository for indication on your position within the [performance datasheet guidance](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/PerformanceDatasheetsAndSizingGuidelines)

\* The most holistic query that you can use is one which will count all
the artifacts in your repo, based on what resides in your index. This is
specifically relevant from Requirements Management 6.0.6 where
[CleanupUnreferencedVersions](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYMRC_6.0.6/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/r_repotools_repairincorrectunrefversions.html)
task has been re-enabled and will reduce the size of the index.

?boundArt . ?binding jfs:resourceContext ?context } UNION { ?link
rdf:type rm:Link . ?link jfs:resourceContext ?context } } GROUP BY
?context ORDER BY ASC (?context )

**For types, ordered rdf:type descending**, append the PREFIX statements
above to the following SPARQL SELECT statement:

Check 'pre-count' and run: \< br /\> SELECT ?type (count(?type) as ?foo
) WHERE { ?resource rdf:type ?type . } GROUP BY ?type ORDER BY
DESC(?foo)

**For a count for a specific Artifact Type**, substitute the following.
Ensure that "Artifact" is replaced with the name of your artifact type.
SELECT (COUNT(\*) AS ?no ) WHERE { ?resource rdf:type . ?resource ?p ?o
}

Alternatively, **select all by Artifact Type:**

SELECT ?type (COUNT(\*) AS ?no ) WHERE { ?resource rdf:type ?type .
?resource ?p ?o } GROUP BY ?type ORDER BY DESC(?no)

**Resources and Triples by Artifact Type:** SELECT ?type (COUNT(\*) AS
?no ) (COUNT(distinct ?resource ) AS ?graphs ) WHERE { ?resource
rdf:type ?type . ?resource ?p ?o } GROUP BY ?type ORDER BY DESC(?no)

**Full triple count:**

SELECT (COUNT(\*) AS ?no ) WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }

**Total number of artifacts:**

PREFIX rm: PREFIX rdf: PREFIX dc: PREFIX jfs: PREFIX rrmNav:

**Total number of artifacts, including module bindings:**

**Number of reviews:**

PREFIX rdf: PREFIX jfs: PREFIX dcterms: PREFIX rrm: PREFIX dc:

# Case study: Comparing RTC 3.0.1.3 and 4.0.3 plan loading performance DKGRAY Authors: Main.GrantCovell, Main.ChetnaWarade, Main.MichaelFiedler [case-study-comparing-rtc-3.0.1.3-and-4.0.3-plan-loading-performance-dkgray-authors-main.grantcovell-main.chetnawarade-main.michaelfiedler]

Last updated: July 11, 2013 Build basis: Rational Team Concert 3.0.1.3,

TOC{title="Page contents"}

Planning is one of the most powerful and frequently used features of
Rational Team Concert. Our clients are able to dynamically view and
manage plans from very tiny team plans to multi-year large plans with
thousands of items and complex team/owner/plan item relationships. With
larger, more complex plans, some clients note sub-optimal performance of
plan loading, have sought techniques to optimize their plan usage and
have asked IBM to improve plan load response times. For the Rational
Team Concert 4.x releases, the development team made significant
improvements to plan loading behavior.

This case study compared identically structured plans of varying sizes
with the goal of determining the difference in plan load time between
Rational Team Concert 3.0.1.3 and 4.0.3. Using the 3.0.1.3 release the
larger plans took more than a minute to load while in 4.0.3 all plans,
regardless of size or browser used, took less than a minute to load. In
this study plans of all sizes loaded faster in 4.0.3 than in 3.0.1.3.
Notably, plans with larger numbers of work items loaded proportionally
faster in 4.0.3.

**NOTE**: We delivered substantial changes to plan loading in 4.0.3.
Several customers identified a prevalent use case / datashape which
prevented the plan-loading improvements from being realized. For some
4.0.3 customers, there was a functional defect which prevented them from
using plans; for other 4.0.3 customers, if they had timelines with data
and workitems that weren't relevant to the current iteration, then they
were retrieving extra data and didn't see plan-loading improvements.
These defects were fixed in hot fixes for 4.0.3, and were resolved in
4.0.4 and 4.0.5. All customers using 4.0.5 or greater should see the
plan-loading improvements.

## Disclaimer

INCLUDE{"PerformanceDatasheetDisclaimerEndToEnd"}

## Summary

Plan loading in Rational Team Concert 4.0.3 has improved markedly over
version 3.0.1.3. Changes were made in the 4.0 release and the 4.0.1
release, but the most substantive changes were made in the 4.0.3
release. For simplicity we are comparing the 3.0.1.3 and 4.0.3 releases
only.

The degree of improvement will vary from environment to environment, and
is influenced by many factors including hardware, operating system,
database, network latency, datashape, workload, workload rate and number
of concurrent users using the application. In our tests with plans of
varying work items, we observed that the greatest improvement in plan
loading times is for those plans with many work items.

## Topology

Two separate physical configurations were built to evaluate plan
performance. No part of the two server configurations use
virtualization. Both the RTC 3.0.1.3 and 4.0.3 environments are running
on RHEL 6.3 on IBM 7914 AC1 / x3550 M4 servers at 2.5 GHz with 32 GB RAM
and 24 logical processors (each physical machine has two sockets, six
cores-per-socket, and two threads-per-core which in total appear as 24
logical processors).

In the 3.0.1.3 environment the application server is WebSphere 7.0.0.27,
and in the 4.0.3 environment the application server is WebSphere
8.5.0.2. The database in the 3.0.1.3 environment is DB2 9.7.0.8, and in
the 4.0.3 environment the database is DB2 10.1.0.2. In the 3.0.1.3
environment the JTS and CCM servers are co-located on the same server,
and in the 4.0.3 environment the JTS and CCM servers are on separate
servers. The max heap setting (-Xms) for the JTS and CCM JVMs is set to
6144 MB.

The plans are accessed using Internet browser applications from a client
machine located in a separate lab (the client is located in Littleton,
Massachusetts, and the servers are located in Raleigh, North Carolina).
The average ping time between the clients and servers is 88 ms (in a
multi-instance ping sample, the min ping was 48 ms and the max was 173
ms). This multi-state latency is typical of many WAN installations.

User authentication is managed by IBM Tivoli Directory server on AIX
platform. Network latency between LDAP authentication server and CLM
application server is less than one second. The web server is IBM HTTP
Server 8.5.

These topologies are derived from the E1 Topology documented at
[Standard Topology (E1) Enterprise - Distributed / Linux /
DB2.](https://jazz.net/library/article/820#Enterprise_Distributed_Linux__DB2)

## Methodology

Using automation we developed five plans of different sizes,
characterized as plans with 300, 600, 1200, 2400 and 9600 work items.
Specific plan characteristics are indicated in the table below.

The five plans were accessed from a machine running Windows 2008 using
three different browsers, Firefox (version 21), Chrome (version
27.0.1453.110) and Internet Explorer (version 9.0.8112.16421). Response
times were measured using built-in web performance tools such as
HttpWatch and Chrome's Developer Tools, as well as stopwatches. Eight
samples were taken for each combination of plan, browser and RTC
version, and the averages and standard deviations calculated.

Note that for the 9600-work-item plan in 3.0.1.3 for all three browsers
that response times were rounded to the nearest second, and that to
accomodate the Chrome Developer Tool's behavior of expressing times
greater than 60 seconds as fractional minutes (eg. 1.1 minutes instead
of 63.56 seconds) a combination of stopwatch and page additions were
used to calculate times in Chrome for the 2400- and 9600-work-item
plans.

The plans were accessed manually as a single user against a server with
no other load. Admittedly these are ideal times given there is no server
load, but the purpose of these tests was to isolate and document 4.0.3
plan loading improvements. We also did not track client or server CPU
activity. We expect that plan performance in an enviroment with active
server load could be less dramatic depending upon server hardware,
network latency, database, and the number of concurrent users and their
workload and workload rate.

## Results

This data table shows response time results comparing 3.0.1.3 and 4.0.3
using three browsers to access the five plans. Overall, 4.0.3
performance is better with generally lower ranges of response times
(standard deviation). Note that in 4.0.3, all plans return in less than
one minute where as in 3.0.1.3 the 2400- and 9600-work-item plans
returned in more than a minute.

This bar graph averages the response times across the three browsers to
show the relative performance improvements. Note that 4.0.3 response
times improve as the size of the plans grows.

These graphs show the same data in the data table above, but grouped by
browser.

For the tests above, we used one type of plan view, the Iteration view.
We also explored different views of a subset of plans. The default view
is Iteration, but Ranked and Breakdown can be configurable defaults. For
this exploration we stayed with Internet Explorer and RTC version 4.0.3
and looked at just the 300-, 600-, and 1200-work-item plan sizes.

For all the tests above each plan had a constant ratio of open and
closed work items. We took one plan size and explored different ratios
of open and closed workitems to see if that made a significant
difference.

# ClearCase Version Importer performance report: Rational Team Concert 4.0.6 release [clearcase-version-importer-performance-report-rational-team-concert-4.0.6-release]

DKGRAY Authors: [Masa Koinuma](Main.MasabumiKoinuma), [Cunxia

The ClearCase Version Importer is a new feature of Rational Team Concert
4.0.5. It can migrate all the versions in any branches in Rational
ClearCase in a single operation, and the version branching is also
replicated in Rational Team Concert source control. This document
provides performance data that you can refer to.

The performance result gives you an idea about how long it takes to
import files and folders using the ClearCase Version Importer, although
this example is not a benchmark. Your performance also varies with the
speed of the server host, database type, and the client host that you
use.

The performance report of 4.0.5 release is available at [ClearCase
Version Importer Performance Report in Rational Team Concert
4.0.5](/library/article/1368). This document also provides some
considerations to migrate the data efficiently.

For more information about the ClearCase Version Importer, see
[Migrating data with the ClearCase Version
Importer](https://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m6/topic/com.ibm.team.connector.scm.cc.doc/topics/c_version_importer_intro.html).

## Topology

In this test environment, all software is installed and configured on a
single host, except for the Rational ClearCase Servers. The ClearCase
Version Importer commands are run on the same host as well. The
following table shows the single server topology variables.

| Metadata Variable | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Operating System | Windows 7 64bit |
| CPU | Intel Core i7-2600 CPU @ 3.4GHz (8-core) |
| Memory | 8GB |
| Network | 100Mbps Ethernet |
| Database Management System | DB2 10.1 |
| Application Server | Tomcat 7 (3GB max heap) |
| License Management System | Trial |
| User Management System | Tomcat |
| Rational ClearCase Client Version | 8.0.1.2 |
| Other technologies | None |

The Rational ClearCase servers are hosted on Solaris Sparc machines. All
the machines are located on the same local network.

## Methodology

The export command of the ClearCase Version Importer runs against the
VOB sub-folders that are listed in the result table, and the duration of
the command is measured.

Then, the intermediate data is imported to a new component of a new
stream on the local CCM server, and the duration of the command is
measured. The user mapping is not configured.

## Results

**Note:** The table shows an average time to import or export the files
per version. The time varies by test case because there are several
other factors that contribute to the duration (such as cleartext pool
cache or the number of files and directories in single Rational Team
Concert component).

# Rational Solution for Collaborative Lifecycle Management 4.x deployment guide [rational-solution-for-collaborative-lifecycle-management-4.x-deployment-guide]

DKGRAY Author: Main.RickMaludzinski Build basis: Rational solution for
Collaborative Lifecycle Management 4.x ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

This guide provides a roadmap to assist you with your deployment of
Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM) 4.x. It is intended to
help you navigate to pertinent documentation on Jazz.net, the
Infocenter, and other resources that are essential for successfully
deploying a new CLM 4.x (also known as CLM 2012) solution or upgrading
to CLM 4.x from a current installed base. It will also answer questions
that typically arise during a deployment scenario with pointers to
additional information should the reader require it. As this guide is
not intended to replace existing documentation available elsewhere you
will note the heavy use of links to tutorials, articles, videos, and
product documentation created by multiple contributors from across the
Jazz development organization.

The intended deployment scenario should guide you through the material
below. If you are not familiar with CLM basics, you should start with
the first section [Introduction to CLM](#IntroCLM). If you are already
familiar with CLM, and will be installing CLM for the first time, then
proceed with [New CLM 4.x Installation](#NewInstall). If you are
upgrading an existing deployment to CLM 4.x, then you should read
[Upgrade to CLM 4.x](#UpgradeCLM).

Disclaimer: This guide is an evolving document and incremental
improvements will be published on a regular basis. For additional

\#IntroCLM

## Introduction to CLM

This section answers the question:

"What are the basics I need to know before I get started with deploying
and configuring CLM?"

This section briefly explains the basics and provides you with links to
more in-depth information and useful tutorials.

If you would like to experiment with some of the features and
capabilities of Rational's solution for Collaborative Lifecycle
Management (CLM) and the Jazz platform, you can [create a CLM
sandbox](https://jazz.net/products/sandbox/). This is a temporary,
hosted environment, where you can create your own sandbox project and
explore and evaluate the capabilities of RTC, RQM and RRC.

### What is CLM?

CLM stands for Collaborative Lifecycle Management. It is an integrated
solution for effective Application Lifecycle Management
([ALM](http://www.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/category/SW860)).
Essentially, it provides integrations between the three core processes
at the foundation of an organization's Software Development Lifecycle
([SDLC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process)):

-   Change and Configuration Management (CCM)
-   Quality Management (QM)
-   Requirements Management (RM)

CCM, QM, and RM are applications that provide capabilities accessible by
product licenses. They are not products - you cannot purchase QM for
example, but you can purchase RQM which gives you capabilities that are
drawn from all three applications. [Building products from
applications](https://jazz.net/blog/index.php/2010/08/16/building-products-from-applications/)
is a good reference that explains the difference between applications
and products.

CLM comprises three products - [Rational Team
Concert](https://jazz.net/projects/rational-team-concert/) (RTC) ,
[Rational Quality
Manager](https://jazz.net/projects/rational-quality-manager/) (RQM), and
[Rational Requirements
Composer](https://jazz.net/projects/rational-requirements-composer/)
(RRC) - that provide the capabilities needed by developers, quality
professionals, and requirements analysts, respectively. One or more
role-based license keys for each product permit access to capabilities
provided by deployed applications. More information on roles and
licensing is provided later in this document in the section Roles and
Licensing in CLM. For an overview of CLM 2012, refer to [Overview of the
CLM
solution](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.help.common.jazz.calm.doc/topics/c_capabilities.html)
in the Infocenter.

The products in CLM 2012 are Rational Team Concert 4.0, Rational Quality
Manager 4.0 and Rational Requirements Composer 4.0.

With the exception of the RM application, which uses the Jazz Team
Server repository for persisting data, each of the applications has its
own data store. The cross-product integrations in CLM support
traceability, web-like navigation, review, commenting, and status
tracking across project repositories with the intent to better
coordinate the flow of people, processes and information. As an example,
a developer can link an enhancement created in CCM to requirements that
were created by an analyst in RM. Additionally, a tester may link one or
more test cases created in QM to the same requirements in RM as well as
the enhancement in CCM. For readers new to CLM, the [Money that Matters
lifecycle](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.clm.tutorial.doc/topics/tut_alm_introduction.html)
scenario in the Infocenter is a excellent tutorial for exploring these
capabilities (here is a [welcome page for the
scenario](https://jazz.net/rm/web#action=com.ibm.rdm.web.pages.showArtifact&artifactURI=https://jazz.net/rm/resources/_-QrUATKjEeGFPKPBgbKpsA)).

### Components of CLM ---++++1. Jazz Team Server

The Jazz Team Server (JTS) is a separately deployed web application that
provides common services to enable applications to work together.
Services include user and project administration, security,
collaboration, query, presentation, process and other generic cross-tool
capabilities. An installed instance of an application is affiliated with
an installed instance of a JTS by registering it as a Jazz Team Server
Extension. Application integration is enabled when multiple applications
share the same JTS.

Note: While a single JTS can support multiple instances of Jazz
applications such as CCM, and QM, only one instance of RM is permitted.

Further reading:

[article](https://jazz.net/projects/jazz-foundation/jazz-team-server/) -
a brief description. \* JTS is based on [RESTful web
services](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-restful/)
and is considered the center of the [Jazz Integration
Architecture(JIA)](https://jazz.net/projects/jazz-foundation/jazz-integration-architecture/)
\* Lifecycle resources (test cases, work items, requirements, etc) that
are exposed by these RESTful services comply with the [Open Services for
Lifecycle Collaboration](http://open-services.net/) standard.

you want to learn how to extend the capabilities of Jazz, you can do a
hands-on workshop called the [RTC Extensions
Workshop](https://jazz.net/library/article/634).

#### 2. Jazz applications

We discussed applications in What is CLM above. A Jazz application is
any application that is deployed to provide some type of service within
a family of Jazz tools and is registered as an extension to JTS.

#### 3. Reporting

CLM 2012 offers two main reporting capabilities:

-   [Development Intelligence
    Reports](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.reporting.overview.doc/topics/c_ovr_rrdi.html)
    are used to communicate status, monitor progress, diagnose problems,
    identify corrective actions, etc. for the purpose of managing
    projects and programs. A pie chart that shows defects categorized by
    customer or a graph depicting test case execution over time are
    examples of this report type.

CLM ships with a set of predefined reports where you can set runtime
parameters for your specific need. However, in order to author new
reports or customize existing reports Rational Reporting for Development
Intelligence (RRDI) is required.

-   [Document-style Reports typically constitute a deliverable
    used](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.reporting.overview.doc/topics/c_ovr_rrdg.html)
    in subsequent phases of a project. An example is a requirements
    specification which is a compilation of requirements into document
    format that can be circulated for review and approval.

RRC, RTC, and RQM users can generate and view document style reports but
the ability to author new report templates requires that Rational
Publishing Engine (RPE) be installed.

[Rational Insight](https://jazz.net/products/rational-insight/) is
required if you want to include data from multiple JTS deployments,
other Rational applications, and third party tools, or if you need to
customize the underlying reporting data warehouse and schema. Note that
CLM 2012 requires Insight 1.1.1 or later.

## Roles and licensing in CLM

A license (also known as a Client Access License or CAL) is associated
with products - RQM Quality Professional, RTC Developer, or RRC Analyst.
These licenses are installed in the JTS and then assigned to the user.
Based on the license assigned, the user has access to certain
capabilities.

A license (also known as a Client Access License or CAL) permits access
to capabilities provided by an application. Role-based licenses are
associated with products. For example, the CCM, QM, and RM applications
each have an author-class license that permits full read-write access to
their capabilities and typically only read access to capabilities
provided by other applications. The three author licenses for CLM 2012
are RTC Developer, RQM Quality Professional, and RRC Analyst. Licenses
are installed in the JTS and then assigned to a user ID. A user ID may
have more than one license assigned to it and any user using that user
ID will have access to the union of capabilities provided by all the
assigned licenses.

Most licenses are available as different types. For example, Authorized
User licenses are permanently assigned to a single user ID until they
are explicitly reassigned. Floating User licenses are acquired
dynamically from a license server when an operation is attempted and
released after an inactivity timeout or explicit logout. Token licenses
are acquired in a similar manner to Floating User licenses but each
license has a token cost and the token pool is managed by a Rational
License Server.

    functionality available, read [Client access license management

\#NewInstall

## New CLM 2012 installation

### Planning the installation

The process for a new installation is relatively straight forward and
has been made easier with the use of the [Interactive Installation
Guide](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_form.html).
Before you get started, you should get familiar with the [CLM
installation
process](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_example_flow_clm.html)
by reviewing the installlation process example.

It is important to note that CLM is an integrated installation - one
download contains all 3 applications and the JTS. During install you can
select what to install so that you have the flexibility to install all
applications on one application server or you can choose to spread the
applications across systems.

#### Supported topologies

There are 3 basic topologies - for details see [Topology
examples](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_topology_overview.html).

-   [Evaluation
    Topology](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_topology_evaluation_examples.html) -
    A single server install used for evaluation purposes only and then
    discarded. If you are planning to create production level artifacts
    you should start with either a departmental or enterprise topology.
-   [Departmental
    Topology](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_topology_departmental_examples.html) -
    This is a good production topology for a group or department when
    there may be limited hardware resources, or the projects and teams
    are relatively small in scope and size and unlikely to expand
    significantly.
-   [Enterprise
    Topology](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_topology_enterprise_examples.html) -
    Suitable for medium- to large-sized teams, this is a distributed
    deployment of Jazz applications meant to scale to support an
    Enterprise.

The article [Standard Collaborative Lifecycle Management
Topologies](https://jazz.net/library/article/820) on jazz.net details
standard topologies to assist you with planning your deployment.

##### Single Sign-On

Single sign-on (SSO) allows users to sign on once to gain access to all
servers without having to re-authenticate for each server. Although
Tomcat supports SSO, it limits SSO to applications that are installed on
a single server. WebSphere Application Server is more flexible where SSO
can be configured in a distributed environment. The Infocenter article
[deploying with single
sign-on](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_deploy_single_sign-on.html)
provides steps for each of the supported application servers. Here is a
[tip for deploying SSO on WAS](https://jazz.net/library/article/413).

##### Server rename

[Server
Rename](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_server_rename_overview.html),
new in CLM 2012, can be useful where you want to prepare a test staging
environment using production data or when moving a pilot deployment into
production. See [supported
scenarios](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_server_rename_sup_unsup.html)
for details. It allows you to update the Scheme/Protocol, Host name,
Port, and Context Root components of the URI. Server rename is complex,
potentially disruptive, and should only be used as a last resort when
other approaches to reconfiguring your topology are unworkable. Often
the use of DNS aliases or a reverse proxy can accomplish your goals. To
enable server rename you must obtain a feature key file from IBM
Software Support. It is called a "Server Rename Feature Key File".

Renaming the application server may require that you [update the port
number](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_ports_change.html)
on the application server. There are additional steps for [changing the
context
root](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_change_context_root.html).

Before proceeding you need to [plan for server
rename](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_server_rename_plan.html)
and review [risks and
limitations](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_server_rename_limitations.html).

\#UriPlanning

#### URI planning

Choosing a public URI for long-term stability is very important as the
applications and JTS generate absolute URIs to resources that are used
for stable resource identification across all applications. In many
cases the URIs are persisted in the repository databases and stored
resources may contain links between them as well as to resources in
other applications. Once resources have been stored in the repository,
changing the URI will have serious consequences.

The absolute URI is rooted by a public URI that is declared for the
applications and JTS. Therefore it is imperative that you choose a
public URI that is [fully
qualified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name),
likely to remain stable over time, and is accessible from anywhere in
the network where users need to connect. Here are some additional
considerations:

-   Use hostnames that can be resolved via DNS (NEVER USE 'localhost' or
    an IP address).
-   Moving a Jazz application from one server to another (even one with
    a different IP address) will maintain any links to the data in the
    repository as long as the domain name remains unchanged and is
    mapped to the new IP address.
-   You must specify a context root for web applications that are
    deployed within the application server. The context root appears
    immediately after the host and port segment of the URL. Default
    context roots are listed below:

| Default Context Root | Description |
|:---|:---|
| /jts | the Jazz Team Server |
| /ccm | Change and Configuration Management capability (provided by RTC) |
| /qm | Quality Management capability (provided by RQM) |
| /rm | Requirements Management capability (provided by RRC) |
| /admin | Jazz Project Administration capability |
| /clmhelp | Help resources |

Example: for a server named jazz_ccm.demo.test, with the /ccm capability
running on it, the base URI for the CCM resource would be
<https://jazz_ccm.demo.test:9443/ccm>.

-   When planning a new installation, if you do not want to use the
    default port numbers (9443) for the application servers you can
    change them. Changing the port numbers for the application server
    explains how.
-   Consider using a reverse proxy or DNS aliases (see the next section)

##### Reverse Proxy and DNS alias

Using a reverse proxy or DNS aliases will help ensure you have the
flexibility to update your topology in the future.

-   A [reverse proxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) is a
    type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client
    from the application servers sitting 'behind' the reverse proxy
    server. For more information see [Using a reverse proxy in your
    topology](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_reverse_proxy.html)
    and a recent blog with additional links to articles explaining
    reverse proxy servers and how to configure them. Here are
    [instructions](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_config_reverse_proxy_ihs.html)
    for configuring the IBM HTTP server as a reverse proxy for IBM
    Websphere Application Server.

<!-- -->

-   Another option is to use a [DNS
    alias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record) for each
    application in your topology so that the public URI can remain
    stable in the event you need to change the configuration.

#### Client / server compatibility

In release 4.0, client N-1 compatibility is supported, which means that
you can upgrade a server to the next release without the need to upgrade
the clients. This backward compatibility applies to the following
clients and is illustrated in the table below:

-   Client for Eclipse IDE
-   Client for Microsoft Visual Studio IDE
-   SCM command line
-   ISPF client

\|\*Eclipse & Visual Studio Client \*\|**Jazz Team Server**\|\|\|\|

|           |         |             |         |         |
|-----------|---------|-------------|---------|---------|
| \^        | **4.0** | **3.0.1.x** | **3.0** | **2.x** |
| **4.0**   | yes     | no          | no      | no      |
| **3.0.1** | yes     | yes         | no      | no      |
| **3.0**   | yes     | yes         | yes     | no      |
| **2.x**   | no      | no          | no      | yes     |

When a server/client mismatch occurs, a friendly dialog explains the
version mismatch. An option is available for customizing the message to
direct users to the location where they can download new clients. How to
do this is explained in [this
article](https://jazz.net/library/article/524) on jazz.net (in the
article, search for the string 'Set the client version mismatch
messages').

As per the above table, RTC users who require access to both v3.x and
v4.0 servers must use a v3.x RTC Eclipse client. If users need to access
both v2.x and v3.x (or v4.0) servers they must use separate RTC Eclipse
clients for each since no single client will work with both servers.

**Notes:**

1.  RTC 4.0 eclipse client can run in Eclipse 3.6 and 3.7 (3.6.2.2 is
    bundled) and supports shell sharing.
2.  RTC repository workspace compatible from v2.x or v3.x to v4.0
    client.
3.  RQM and RRC 4.0 clients are web-browser based. There is no Eclipse
    client for these products.
4.  CLM 4.0 Server Rename feature: you must upgrade all RTC clients
    (including build engines) to version 4.0 prior to the rename.

#### Performing the installation

For an understanding of the key concepts that are involved in performing
the installation, refer to [Understanding the deployment and
installation
process](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_what_to_install.html).

For a new CLM installation you will perform the following:

-   Prepare for the installation - see [Preparing the
    installation](#PrepInstall).
-   [Use the Interactive Installation Guide](#UseIUG) to guide you
    through the installation steps. You can choose various options to
    define your topology including whether you want to install RRDI.
-   [Run the setup wizard](#RunSetup) to connect the applications and
    database to JTS v4.0.
-   You probably don't have a build system installed so refer to
    [Install and configure the build system](#InstallBuildsys).
-   If you plan to use floating CALs or Token services for your
    licensing scheme then you must [install and configure a license
    server](#InstallLIC).
-   If you want the ability to author new document style report
    templates you will need to [install and configure RPE](#InstallRPE).

\#PrepInstall

##### Preparing the installation

Before starting:

-   Be sure to have properly selected your URI's for your Jazz
    capabilities. See [URI Planning](#UriPlanning) for more information.
-   Read the release notes available on the product downloads pages.
-   Verify that the [system
    requirements](https://jazz.net/library/article/811) are met.
-   Decide on the user registry to be used. Your options will depend on
    the application server you are using. Tomcat has a default user
    registry whereas WebSphere offers a range of possible configurations
    for user registry as described in [Selecting a registry or
    repository](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/tsec_useregistry.html).
    Both application servers can be configured to use LDAP. Refer to
    [setting up user
    management](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_plan_user_management.html)
    for details.
-   Decide on the database vendor to be used and review the installation
    instructions in [Setting up the
    database](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_s_server_installation_setup_db.html).
    Instructions are provided for DB2, Oracle, and SQL server.

For an enterprise deployment you will need to install a database server
and configure a database for each of the following:

-   Data warehouse database (optional)
-   Jazz Team Server database
-   CCM database (if the CCM application will be installed)
-   QM database (if the QM application will be installed)
-   RRDI content store (if RRDI is installed)

Note: RM does not require its own database as it uses the JTS database.

\* If installing RRDI, make sure that the RRDI application is installed
on a separate server instance. This will ensure that heavy reporting
loads on the system do not impact the performance of the CLM tools. \*
Review the [Collaborative Lifecycle Management 2012 Sizing Report
(Standard Topology E1)](SizingReportCLM2012) to assist you with
maximizing system performance. Also review [factors that can affect
performance](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/index.jsp?topic=2Fcom.ibm.jazz.install.doc2Ftopics2Ft_max_perf.html).
\* Have your instructions handy. It is strongly recommended that you use
the [Interactive Installation
Guide](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_form.html)
available from the Infocenter as it compiles installation instructions
specific to your scenario.

-   New for CLM 2012: If you are using Websphere Application Server, you
    now have the option to configure a cluster of app servers.
-   If you need to be able to author new reports or customize existing
    reports be sure to select 'yes' to install Rational Reporting for
    Development Intelligence.

If you want to install the product as a non-root user on UNIX systems or
as a non-administrator on Windows, in the Select user mode for
Installation Manager, select Non-Administrator.

\#UseIUG

##### Use the interactive installation guide

The [Interactive Installation
Guide](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_form.html)
takes you through the following main steps:

**Planning checklist**

\* [Installing the server using IBM Installation
Manager](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_s_server_installation_im.html) -
you have 2 options - a web based install or a local install.

-   Install and configure databases. You can use Derby which is included
    with the installer but its use should be limited to trial and demo
    deployments. And note that RRDI does not support Derby - although
    you can configure a data warehouse on Derby, you will not be able to
    migrate your data to another database vendor.

For any other deployment, instructions are provided for
[DB2](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_s_server_installation_setup_db2.html),
[Oracle](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_s_server_installation_setup_oracle.html),
and [SQL
Server](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_s_server_installation_setup_sql.html).

-   Install, set up, and start the Application Server(s) - Tomcat
    Application Server v7.0 comes with the installation but if you are
    planning to use Websphere Application Server then you should not
    install Tomcat. During installation, you will be asked to provide
    the directory where the webbapps are to be placed (the default
    location is JazzInstallDir/server/webapps). Later in the install
    process you will deploy these web apps to the application server.

<!-- -->

-   If you selected to install Tomcat v7.0 you are good to go. To start
    the server(s) refer to [Starting the Apache Tomcat
    Server](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/m_s_server_installation_start_tomcat.html).
    Websphere Application Server (WAS) is a separate install - you can
    set up WAS using the [Integrated Solutions
    Console](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_s_server_installation_setup_WAS.html)
    or using [Jython
    scripting](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_configure_was_jython.html).
    Depending on your desired topology, you may be installing one or
    more application servers (eg. one app server for each of JTS, CCM,
    QM, RM).

<!-- -->

-   WAS includes some addition steps to [configure the server to use
    LDAP](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_instl_config_ldap_on_was.html)
    (this is optional) and to [deploy the web applications and start the
    server](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_deploy_was.html).
    In addition to the web archives for JTS, CCM, QM, and RM, you will
    also be deploying web archives for the following applications:
    -   Lifecycle Project Administration (LPA) - admin.war
    -   Information Center (IC) - clmhelp.war
    -   RM view mode version of the graphical artifacts - converter.war

<!-- -->

-   Install the RTC client for Eclipse IDE. Refer to [Install the
    Eclipse Client](#InstallEclipse) later in this article.

<!-- -->

-   If you selected to install RRDI, the installation package consists
    of Rational Report Server and optional sample reports (the samples
    are not related to CLM data). [Review the planning
    checklist](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.rrdi.admin.doc/topics/c_planning_tasks_checklist.html),
    [installation
    requirements](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.rrdi.admin.doc/topics/c_install_req_overview.html),
    and [deployment
    scenarios](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.rrdi.admin.doc/topics/c_install_topology_overview.html)-
    for a departmental or enterprise deployment, RRDI is installed on a
    separate application server with its content store created on the
    database server. The installation procedure is described in
    installing
    [RRDI](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.rrdi.admin.doc/topics/t_install.html).

<!-- -->

-   Once RRDI has been installed, you will need to [create the database
    for content
    store](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.rrdi.admin.doc/topics/t_configure_content_store_combine.html),[
    Initialize the reporting
    server](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.rrdi.admin.doc/topics/t_postinstall_config_setup_app.html)
    and then run the [RRDI set up
    wizard](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.rrdi.admin.doc/topics/t_postinstall_start_setup_app.html)
    to configure RRDI. Finally integrating RRDI with CLM data requires
    that you load the Cognos archive files from the JTS as described in
    [Integrating RRDI with CLM data
    sources](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.rational.rrdi.admin.doc/topics/t_postinstall_integrate_rrdi_clm.html).

<!-- -->

-   Now that the servers are started run the setup wizard as described
    next.

\#RunSetup

##### Run the setup wizard

The Setup Wizard walks you through some final configuration steps to
connect the applications and database to JTS v4.0. The Setup Wizard
helps you to:

-   Configure the public URI
-   Configure database connections
-   Configure email settings
-   Register applications
-   Configure the user registry
-   Configure the data warehouse
-   Finalize Setup for each application

After ensuring the application server(s) have been started launch the
wizard. In a browser window type:

**\[fully qualified hostname\]:\[port number\]/jts/setup**

The default port number for the application servers is 9443. It is
recommended that each of the application servers and applications have
their own unique port numbers. This makes it easier to debug any
potential performance issues and allows for implementation of a [reverse
proxy
server](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_reverse_proxy.html)
at a later time. You can change the port number by referring to the
following procedure: [Changing the port number for the application
server](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_ports_change.html).
You should also select a unique context root. Note that you should
change the port number and context root ***before*** setting the public
URI for your applications.

The JTS, along with the applications registered to the JTS, is called an
application group. In a single server configuration, the applications
that need to be registered are found automatically. In a distributed
system, where the applications are installed on different machines from
the JTS (we call these 'remote' applications), registering the
applications with the JTS can be done when you initially set up your CLM
environment by [running the setup
wizard](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_s_server_installation_setup_wizard.html)
for enterprise deployments or you can [run the setup on the
command-line](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_running_setup_command_line.html).

If you have an existing Jazz CLM environment, and you are adding a new
server and/or capability, then you will need to register the new
application with the JTS by following to these
[instructions](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.repository.web.admin.doc/topics/t_register.html).

\#InstallBuildsys

##### Install and configure the build system The Jazz Build System Toolkit contains the Jazz Build Engine (JBE) and a toolkit of Ant tasks that processes manual and scheduled build requests, executes builds, and publishes logs. You can use any build engine to run Jazz Team Builds (such as the Build Forge build engine). For details on variations refer to [Jazz Team Build setup variations](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/csetupwithexistingtools.html).

The Build System Toolkit can be be installed [using the IBM Installation
Manager](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_install_build_toolkit_im.html)
or it can be installed from a .zip file. If you will be using the Build
Forge build engine, refer to [Installing the Rational Build
Agent](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/BF_install_buildagent_overview.html).

For an overview of the steps involved in setting up and running a
typical Jazz Team Build, refer to [A typical Jazz Team Build
setup](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/c_buildsetup.html).
The detailed procedure for performing the build tasks can be done [using
the Eclipse
client](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/c_working_in_eclipse.html)
or using the Web client. If you intend to use the Eclipse client, refer
to [Install the Eclipse Client below](#InstallEclipse).

\#InstallLIC

##### Install and configure a license server

If you plan to use floating CALs or Token services for your licensing
scheme then you will need to install and configure a license server.

Floating CALs are managed as a pool that are shared by multiple users
who acquire a license when they need it and return it to the pool when
they are done. You can either have a dedicated JTS that serves floating
CALs or you can use an existing JTS. See [Installing and managing
floating client access license
keys](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.repository.web.admin.doc/topics/tmanagefloatinglic.html)
for instructions on configuring a floating license server and to point
other jazz team servers to the license server.

A floating CAL server can also distribute Rational Common Licensing
(RCL) tokens. Jazz services have a predetermined 'token cost' associated
with them and when a user invokes the service, the required number of
tokens are checked out from the license server. Token services requires
an additional license server called the IBM Rational License Key Server.
Please refer to the [RCL
information](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rational/v0r0m0/index.jsp)
center for installation instructions.

For more information on Jazz Licensing and some background on how it
works, check out the [CLM 2011 Licensing
Article](https://jazz.net/library/article/548). Some of it may be out of
date, but the core concepts hold true.

\#InstallRPE

##### Install and configure RPE

Refer to the Rational Publishing Engine 1.1.2.2 Infocenter for
instructions on [Installing
RPE](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rpehelp/v1r1m1/topic/com.ibm.rational.pe.install.doc/topics/t_installing_rpe_1.1.2.html)
and integrating CLM data sources ([integrating

\#InstallEclipse

##### Install the Eclipse Client

There are three ways to install the client. Refer to [Client
Installation
Overview](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_client_installation_overview.html)
for details.

\#UpgradeCLM

## Upgrade to CLM 2012

**Before proceeding**: If you have Insight in your current deployment,
you will require Insight version 1.1.1 or higher along with the upgrade
to CLM 2012. Check the latest system requirements of the CLM version you
are upgrading to for complete details. If you are upgrading from CLM
2010, you can proceed with the first step (upgrade to CLM 2011) and then
proceed with the upgrade to Insight 1.1.1or higher.

If you have RRDI in your current deployment, upgrade to CLM 2012 first
then proceed with the upgrade to RRDI. **Note**: This suggested order is
the latest recommendation as of June 2013

For more information on the reporting considerations during an upgrade,
please see [Reporting
Considerations](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/UpgradePlanning#Reporting_considerations)
section in Upgrade Planning deployment wiki page.

CLM 2012 is backward compatible with the 3.0.x clients and servers
providing you with more flexibility in planning and executing your
upgrade. You can execute the upgrade in stages, say by starting with the
JTS and one application, such as CCM, and upgrading those applications
first. Then, at a later time you can upgrade the remaining applications
as well as the Eclipse and Visual Studio clients.

Although a mixed 3.x and 4.0 environment is supported, for compatibility
with JTS 4.0 you will need RQM 3.0.1.3 and RRC 3.0.1.4.

If you are upgrading from CLM 2010, you will need to perform a 2-step
upgrade process by first upgrading to CLM 3.0.1.x (also known as CLM
2011) and then finally to CLM 2012.

### Two-step upgrade from CLM 2010 to CLM 2012

Upgrading from CLM 2010 to CLM 2012 is a 2-step process:

1.  Upgrade from CLM 2010 to CLM 2011: refer to [Understanding the
    deployment and upgrade
    process](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v3r0m1/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_understand_upgrade.html)
    in the 3.0.1 Information Center. As well, review the [Upgrade
    process
    examples](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v3r0m1/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_upgrade_process_overview.html)
    and [Upgrade topolgy
    example](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v3r0m1/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_upgrade_topology_overview.html)
    and then use the [Interactive upgrade
    guide](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v3r0m1/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_clm_upgrade.html)
    to perform the upgrade to CLM 2011. Note all these links are on the
    3.0.1 Information Center. For a summary of the tasks you should
    complete in preparation for the upgrade, read the article [Upgrade
    reference for CLM 2011](https://jazz.net/library/article/698). The
    [CLM 2011 Upgrade Workshop](https://jazz.net/library/article/662)
    provides a hands-on walk through of the CLM 2011 upgrade process.
    The [CLM 2011 Upgrade FAQ](https://jazz.net/library/article/679) is
    also a great source of information. 2. Upgrade from CLM 2011 to CLM
    2012 - see the next section below.

If the upgrade is planned such that step 2 is to be done at a later
time, the eclipse and visual studio clients should be upgraded to be
compatible with the 3.0.1 server at the same time step1 is done. If it
is acceptable that the client upgrades can wait until the upgrade is
complete, it would be wise to inform users that only the web client
should be used in the interim. Here are [instructions for upgrading the
clients](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v3r0m1/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_upgrade_client_vs_eclipse.html)
to v3.x.

### Upgrade from CLM 3.0.1 to CLM 4.0

For an understanding of the key concepts that are involved in performing
an upgrade, refer to [Understanding the deployment and upgrade
process](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_understand_upgrade.html).
You should also review [Deployment and upgrade
considerations](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_upgrade_consideration.html),
[Upgrade process
example](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_upgrade_flow_clm.html),
[Upgrade topology
example](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_upgrade_topology_ex_dist_clm_ent.html),
and the [CLM 2012 Upgrade Guide](https://jazz.net/library/article/819).

A CLM 3.0.1 to CLM 4.0 upgrade requires a full installation of CLM 4.0
followed by an upgrade script (one for each application) which migrates
and updates configuration files, adds tables to the various database
repositories in place, and upgrades the data warehouse. The upgrade
should be staged with the JTS being upgraded first, followed by the
applications, which can be done in any order. Use the interactive guide,
[Upgrading to version
4.0](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_clm_upgrade.html),
to generate upgrade instructions specific to your deployment topology,
application and database servers, data warehouse configuration, product
integrations, etc. It is important to note that you should not run the
setup wizard during the upgrade process.

An upgrade in a Tomcat environment is straight-forward and essentially
involves shutting down each of the servers hosting the JTS or CLM
application, installing the JTS or CLM application, running an upgrade
script on each server to update configuration files and tables (and the
data warehouse in the case of JTS), and lastly, starting the servers.
Note that for the RM application, there is an online migration phase
after the server has been started.

An upgrade in a WAS deployment involves additional steps to backup the
server profile, uninstall the 3.0.1 JTS/CLM apps from WAS, clean up some
directories, update properties, etc. and then running an upgrade script
on each server to update configuration files and tables (and the data
warehouse in the case of JTS). After starting the server, the last step
is to deploy the 4.0 war files and start the applications. Note that for
the RM application, there is an online migration phase after the server
has been started.

To review an upgrade scenario in a fully distributed WAS deployment
refer to the article [CLM 2012 Upgrade
Guide](https://jazz.net/library/article/819) on jazz.net. The CLM 4.0
upgrade guide also provides troubleshooting and FAQ sections as well as
other information to help guide you through the upgrade process.

Notes:

1.  3.0.1 did not require 64bit OS - whereas a 64 bit OS is a
    requirement for 4.0
2.  The 2011 Eclipse and Visual Studio clients are compatible with CLM
    2012 and can therefore be upgraded at a later time. Here are
    [instructions for upgrading the
    clients](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_upgrade_client_vs_eclipse.html).
3.  For RRC you still need to perform an online migration. Instructions
    are provided in the interactive upgrade guide [Upgrading to version
    4.0](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_clm_upgrade.html).

### Upgrade an existing Jazz environment to CLM 2012

In this scenario you already have a Jazz-based product (RTC, RQM, RRC)
in your network and now you would like to upgrade to CLM 2012.

If you are starting with a 2.x product, you will have to upgrade the
product to 3.0.1 first by following the [Interactive upgrade
guide](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v3r0m1/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_clm_upgrade.html)
in the 3.0.1 Information Center. As you select the options that describe
your environment, you will choose your deployment topology. This is
where you can specify that you want to begin distributing your
applications on multiple machines if you have not already installed a
separate JTS.

If you are starting with 3.0.1 products or have just finished upgrading
to 3.0.1, the next step is to upgrade to version 4.0 using the
[Interactive upgrade
guide](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_clm_upgrade.html)
in the 4.0 Information Center.

Now that you have upgraded to version 4.0, the next step is to install
the remaining applications to make up a full CLM 2012 offering. For
this, use the [Interactive installation
guide](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_form.html).

### Administration

Before we start, a few definitions would be useful. A
[repository](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.repository.web.admin.doc/topics/c_repository.html)
is a central location for tool-specific information. It is a data store
containing top level objects called items that have a Universally Unique
Identifier (UUID). Some item types maintain a history of changes for
audit purposes, while other item types do not. APIs are provided for
creating, retrieving, updating and deleting items as well as running
queries on the repository.

Each CLM application (CCM, QM, RM) uses a [project
area](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/c_project_area.html)
to organize a software project. A project area is a top level or root
item in a repository that defines the project's deliverables, team
structure, process, and schedule. There can be many project areas in a
repository. In a CLM deployment, artifacts across application projects
can be linked to support cross-application traceability.

A project area can contain multiple teams and [team
areas](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/c_team_area.html)
are the mechanism for organizing them. A team area includes team
members, the timeline to which the team is assigned, and the process to
which the team has subscribed. Team areas are optional - they may not be
needed for small projects or project teams.

In CLM, each of the applications has their own project area. A
[lifecycle
project](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.team.concert.doc/topics/c_getting_started_project_areas_and_lifecycle_projects.html)
groups multiple project areas so that the project areas can be managed
from a central location. The application that is used to administer
project areas is called Lifecycle Project Administration (LPA). In [Run
the Setup Wizard](#RunSetup) during a new CLM installation you may
recall registering LPA with the server.

#### Common project administration

There are several administrative tasks that are common to CCM, QM, and
RM such as creating project areas and team areas, creating timelines and
iterations, adding users to a project area, and adding and modifying
roles and permissions. These common administration tasks are described
in [Administering project areas: Tasks for all applications (web
client)](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/c_common_project_admin_tasks.html).
Alternatively, you can use the Lifecycle Project Administration (LPA)
application to create and manage project areas across applications,
which is what we will be doing in the next section.

##### Setting up projects

To create a lifecycle project and project areas, [log into Lifecycle
Project
Administration](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/t_starting_project_administration_application.html)
and either [create a lifecycle project from a
template](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/t_creating_aggregate_projects_from_template.html)
or, if you have existing project areas, then you can
\[<http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/t_creating_aggregate_project_and_adding_project_areas.html>\[\]\[create
a lifecycle project and add existing project areas\]\].

When you create a project area you will need to specify a process
template to use.
[Process](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/c_process.html)
specifies the roles, practices, rules, and guidelines that are used to
organize and control the flow of work in a project. It defines
permissions for performing operations within the project, and can be
used to define project reports, queries, and work item types. Jazz
includes [process
templates](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/c_process_template.html)
for common processes that you can use as-is or customize to suit your
organization.

If users have not yet been created, follow the [instructions to create
users](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.repository.web.admin.doc/topics/taddnewuser.html)
in the Jazz Team Server repository. Once created, users can be added to
projects (see [add members to
projects](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/t_adding_members_to_projects.html))
and assigned roles (see [assigning
roles](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/t_assigning_roles_lpa.html)).
[Roles](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/c_roles.html)
identify the functions of team members and determines which operations a
user can perform. If email notification has been enabled, the newly
added user will receive a team invitation with instructions on how to
accept it.

Once you have your project areas created and have added members the next
steps are to [create timelines, iterations, and iteration
types](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/c_creating_timelines_iterations_iteration_types.html)
and optionally [create team
areas](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/c_creating_team_areas_associating_categories.html)
for organizing project teams. For a complete set of common
administrative tasks refer to [Administering project areas: Tasks for
all applications (web
client](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/c_common_project_admin_tasks.html)).

##### Enabling email notification You can modify the server configuration properties such as database connections, feed settings, OAuth consumers, etc. from the admin page of the JTS or the admin page of an application registered with the server. See [Configuring the Server](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.repository.web.admin.doc/topics/tconfigserver.html) for a complete list but for now, if you want to send email notifications to work item owners and subscribers to inform them of changes then you need to [configure e-mail settings](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.repository.web.admin.doc/topics/tconfigemail.html) since the default is that email notifications are disabled.

##### Managing users

User information is stored in the JTS database where it is shared by the
server and by all applications registered with the JTS. User information
is also stored in an external registry such as LDAP. A task can be
scheduled to run regularly to synchronize data in the two locations. For
details refer to [Managing
users](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.repository.web.admin.doc/topics/tmanageusers.html) -
when getting started with CLM 2012, the key user administration
functions are [creating
users](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.repository.web.admin.doc/topics/taddnewuser.html)
and [assigning
licenses](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.repository.web.admin.doc/topics/tmanageusercal.html).

#### Additional administrative tasks

The above description focused on the administrative tasks that are
common to CCM, QM, and RM. Additional administration tasks specific to
these applications can be found in [Administering change and
configuration management project
areas](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0/topic/com.ibm.jazz.platform.doc/topics/t_projects_teams_process.html),

# Collaborative Lifecycle Management architecture overview [collaborative-lifecycle-management-architecture-overview]

DKGRAY Authors: Main.TimFeeney Build basis: The Rational solution for
Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM) ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is a broad Rational solution
category. ALM is also a market category, with vendors providing
solutions competing for market share in this space. Industry analysts
and tool vendors define it differently. Wikipedia uses the
[ALM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management)
definition from an SD Times article by Jennifer Dedong:

*..a continuous process of managing the life of an application through
governance, development and maintenance. ALM is the marriage of business
management to software engineering made possible by tools that
facilitate and integrate requirements management, architecture, coding,
testing, tracking, and release management*

Forrester analyst Carey Schwaber, in The Changing Face of Application
Lifecycle Management (Forrester Research, August 18, 2006), states, ALM
is the thread that ties the development lifecycle together.

While the definitions vary, you can see that creation and management of
any asset used in the development of software is important to ALM.

IBM Rational has a broad set of tools supporting the development of
software that includes the core capabilities of change management,
project management, requirements definition and management, design
management, construction & software configuration management, deployment
management (software delivery automation) and quality management.

By assembling a solution that covers these core capabilities, software
development teams can focus on solving complex business problems.

For a 5-minute introduction to ALM, [watch this video on
Jazz.net](https://jazz.net/library/video/345). For a short introduction
to Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC), watch this [video
on open-services.net](http://open-services.net/about/).

## Overview

The lead ALM solution from IBM Rational software is the Rational
solution for Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM), which consists of
Rational Requirements Composer, Rational Team Concert, Rational Quality
Manager and Rational Software Architect with Design Management

The Jazz platform is strategic for implementing the Rational solution
for CLM. The Jazz platform is all about collaboration; it allows
individual products to integrate better and more easily, and allows the
users of those products who take on distinct roles to work more
effectively together than has historically been possible. The Jazz
platform supports a more collaborative approach to ALM tools and their
users.

That approach is open. It leverages the standards used by the Internet.
Just as the internet works with data spread around the world, the
approach is to allow development team data to be spread around an
organization, and yet be as easily accessible as surfing the
world-wide-web. Through the support for
[OSLC](http://open-services.net/html/Home.html), integrations can be
provided for both Jazz-based and classic products. Additionally, third
party vendors and customers can consume or provide their own OSLC
interfaces to support heterogeneous environments made up of Rational,
third party, and/or customer solutions. The combination of Jazz and OSLC
provides the ability to have unprecedented collaboration, transparency,
automation, and traceability.

Effective ALM can help address current business requirements, enhance
productivity with automation, and accelerate decision-making. The key
word here is effective. ALM is not a one-size-fits-all type of solution;
instead, to be effective, you should implement ALM in a way that best
suits your development environment and your companys culture. IBM
Rational software professionals have defined [Five ALM
Imperatives](https://jazz.net/library/article/637) that can help ensure
an effective ALM implementation. These imperatives have been developed
after more than 20 years of implementing ALM, have been used time and
time again, and can be applied to just about any implementation:

-   Maximize product value with **in-context collaboration**
-   Accelerate time to delivery with **real-time planning**
-   Improve quality with **lifecycle traceability**
-   Refine predictability with **development intelligence**
-   Reduce costs with **continuous improvement.**

In summary, "CLM" expresses the proper scope and differentiated value of
our solution. This approach leverages the value that Jazz brings across
both IT and systems delivery, delivered via five ALM imperatives.

## Solution components

The Rational solution for CLM , which is covered by this architecture
document, is comprised of the following applications running on a common
Jazz Team Server: Requirements Management (RM), Change and Configuration
Management (CCM), Quality Management (QM), and Design Management (DM).
These applications are used by a set of products, including the Rational
solution for CLM. These products are:

-   **Rational Requirements Composer (RRC):** helps teams define and use
    requirements effectively across the project lifecycle including rich
    editors for both textual and visual requirements capabilities for
    lean requirements definition, including the creation of use cases,
    sketches and storyboards.

<!-- -->

-   **Rational Team Concert (RTC):** integrates change management,
    source control management, continuous builds (software delivery
    automation), project planning and reporting/dashboard capabilities.

<!-- -->

-   **Rational Quality Manager (RQM):** provides a shared test
    management hub for test planning, creation, and execution as well as
    workflow control, tracking, and end-to-end traceability.

<!-- -->

-   **Rational Software Architect with Design Management (RSA-DM):**
    enables teams to share, collaborate and manage design information
    across the application development lifecycle.

In addition to these applications, the Rational solution for CLM
provides two types of reporting capabilities:

-   **Rational Reporting for Development Intelligence (RRDI):** allows
    creation and viewing of chart and dashboard style reports. It is an
    optional install in CLM 2012. When installed and configured it
    provides users with an additional set of predefined development
    intelligence reports, as well as the ability to author new reports.
    Rational Reporting for Development Intelligence is based on the
    Cognos Business Intelligence (BI) platform.

<!-- -->

-   **Rational Reporting for Document Generation (RRDG):** provides
    support for generation of document style reports. In CLM 2012,
    Rational Reporting for Document Generation is included as part of
    Rational Requirements Composer, Rational Team Concert, and Rational
    Quality Manager. Authoring functionality for document style reports
    is provided by a separate purchase of Rational Publishing Engine
    (RPE).

In addition to these applications, the Rational solution for CLM
includes a set of process and practices and supporting tool extensions,
all packaged in a **Rational Method Composer (RMC)** configuration. The
CLM processes and practices include everything the you need to run the
solution. They describe the context and usage model for the products
that support the solution -- step-by-step guidance on how to apply the
solution, including product guidance in tool mentors. The practices are
self-documenting and include Jazz process templates (including Rational
Team Concert process and work item templates) for enacting the solution.
A published version of the configuration for IBM internal consumption
and inline comments can be found
[here](http://rupository.svl.ibm.com:3000/wikis/clm_2012/index.htm).
Customers that have purchased the necessary Rational Method Composer
reader licenses can download the configuration from the [IBM Rational
Solution Process Assets
page](https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2360&uid=swg24030663).

[Rational Team
Concert](https://jazz.net/projects/rational-team-concert), [Rational
Quality Manager](https://jazz.net/projects/rational-quality-manager) and
[Rational Requirements
Composer](https://jazz.net/projects/rational-requirements-composer)
share a common installer that deploys the shared Jazz Team Server plus
the Change and Configuration Management, Quality Management, and
Requirements Management applications. The trial licenses that are
installed in the Jazz Team Server provide access to the capabilities of
these products. This means that you can install *any of these products*
to enable the full set of [collaborative lifecycle
management](https://jazz.net/projects/clm) capabilities provided by all
the products. To learn more about applications, capabilities and product
license keys, read the [Building products from
applications](https://jazz.net/blog/index.php/2010/08/16/building-products-from-applications/#_blank)
blog post. Though it currently requires a separate installer, [Rational
Software Architect with Design
Management](https://jazz.net/products/design-management/), part of the
Rational solution for CLM, can be installed into the shared Jazz Team
Server to provide design management capabilities.

## Solution configurations

Any of the CLM products can be used individually or combined as an
organization's first step towards fully leveraging the power of
Collaborative Lifecycle Management. With each tool adopted, the
organization will see continual improvements in quality and efficiency.

## High level solution topology

The CLM product components are built on top of Jazz Team Server, which
provides the foundational services that enable a group of tools to work
together as a single logical server. The figure below shows a typical
departmental installation topology using the current product versions.
Each application shares an associated version of Jazz Team Server. The
deployment can leverage a single database server to host the individual
database instances. This helps to reduce administrative costs including
simplifying backup procedures, although is not required. The diagram
below shows the various product components or applications. These
applications represent capabilities and do not map 1:1 to the products.
For example, Rational Quality Manager contains capabilities that are
found in each of the applications (CCM, RM, QM, DM and JTS) shown below.
A Rational Quality Manager Quality Professional license has access to
defining textual requirements in the RM application, work items and
plans in the CCM application, and all capacities in the QM application
and Jazz Team Server.

Although the Rational solution for CLM supports a very wide variety of
deployment topologies and supporting operating systems and software,
start from a selected set of the most tested and understood
combinations. These standard topologies can be found in the [Deployment
planning and design](DeploymentPlanningAndDesign) section of this wiki.

## Product interfaces

The Jazz initiative aims to improve software & system lifecycle
integration. This initiative consists of three elements:

-   An **open architecture** for lifecycle tool integration
-   An **open community** working together to integrate and develop
    lifecycle tools
-   A **catalog of products** that support the Jazz initiative.

The Jazz project includes the following:

-   [Collaborative Application Lifecycle Management
    Scenarios](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/CALMHome) the
    scenarios work from the outside-in by providing real-world, role and
    task based user experiences that explore end-user goals and their
    needs to access data throughout the lifecycle. They are designed to
    validate the Jazz Integration Architecture, Jazz Foundation, and
    OSLC specifications.

<!-- -->

-   [OSLC](http://open-services.net/) to unlock the information buried
    within development tools, open and agreed upon interfaces are needed
    that allow different tools to share and exchange the data that they
    produce. By creating specifications that define common shapes, uses,
    and relations between software lifecycle data, the OSLC community
    helps us eliminate traditional barriers between tools and to open
    the door to new forms of collaboration. OSLC specifications are
    based on Internet standards, including a novel use of [Linked
    Data](http://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkedData) not only for reading, but
    also for creating and updating. OSLCs use of linked data to enable
    protocol-based integrations of software tools is often referred to
    as linked lifecycle data.

<!-- -->

-   [Jazz Integration Architecture
    (JIA)](http://jazz.net/projects/DevelopmentItem.jsp?href=content/project/plans/jia-overview/index.html)
    a set of inter-connected technologies and specifications, consisting
    of reference architecture, API specifications, a set of common
    services and tool building blocks. At the center of JIA is the Jazz
    Foundation Services, which provides services to enable groups of
    tools to work together. Powering much of JIA are standard RESTful
    APIs and standard resource definitions, which enable participating
    tools to easily share data.

<!-- -->

-   [Jazz Foundation](https://jazz.net/projects/jazz-foundation/) an
    implementation of the Jazz Foundation Services, and optional
    toolkits to aid in the construction of Jazz applications.

The Jazz Architecture is an **open architecture** for lifecycle tool
integration that supports a range of integration patterns, embracing
linked lifecycle data (OSLC) for sharing lifecycle resources, and
defines Jazz Integration Services for common capabilities like
administration, reporting, dashboards, etc.

The value of Jazz Integration Services:

-   Jazz integration services provide additional ways to help lifecycle
    tools work well together, for example, user administration, team
    collaboration, license administration, team process, traceability,
    and reporting
-   Individual Jazz integration services designed to be used
    independently
-   Each lifecycle tool can select those services that provide value for
    that tool's customers
-   Allows new and improved forms of integration to be added to the mix
    as they are developed.

The Jazz Integration Architecture implements OSLC specifications for
integration:

-   Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration is an open community of
    developers and organizations who collaborate across many software
    lifecycle domains to help standardize how software lifecycle tools
    share data.
-   Jazz products maintain loose coupling between interacting lifecycle
    tools via domain-specific OSLC interfaces and are not tied to a
    particular tool
-   This allows Jazz products to be upgraded independently of one
    another
-   Ensures the architecture is open to new lifecycle tools, where any
    lifecycle tool written by a vendor, an open source project, or
    in-house development, can consume or provide the OSLC protocols.
    This enables customers to integrate lifecycle tools they already
    use.

For CLM, there are four important domains that must be integrated, and
four important OSLC specifications that define how: Change Management,
Design Management, Requirements Management, and Quality Management. This
classification of key concepts of ALM simplifies the integration points,
not only between the CLM components, but also for third-party, open
source, or in-house tools. Any product can act as a provider, a
consumer, or both, of linked lifecycle data, and integrate with any
other tool that does the same. This open and flexible approach is how
the integration of each customers unique set of software lifecycle tools
is made a practical reality.

The products covered in this architecture brief implement OSLC
specifications; as such, they are either a provider or a consumer of
linked lifecycle data. The key specifications are: change management,
requirements management, and quality management.

Source: <http://open-services.net/software>

Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration provides open, public
descriptions of resources and formats for sharing artifacts across the
software lifecycle. The term *artifact* is commonly used to describe the
content the users interact with. In the programmable web, this is called
a resource. The strategy treats all development artifacts as resources
at the end of the URI, where both XML and JSON are supported formats.
RESTful interfaces are used to GET, PUT, POST or DELETE data in each of
the repositories. Each tool implements the OSLC specification for their
domain (for example, change management, requirements management, quality
management). In addition, tools that integrate the Jazz Foundation
provide the additional benefit of a common UI framework, link-types
describing cross-discipline relationships, rich hovers, queries,
dashboards that host cross-repository widgets, and much more.

For example, when a requirements user chooses to link to, or create an
artifact in Rational Team Concert, Rational Requirements Composer uses
the Rational Team Concert change management RESTful interface to send
the data defined by the public [OSLC change management
specification](http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/CmHome). Per the
specification, Rational Requirements Composer delegates the user
interface to Rational Team Concert, meaning, the details and semantics
provided by Rational Team Concert are consumed by and displayed in a
Rational Requirements Composer dialog. When the user clicks OK, Rational
Requirements Composer sends a PUT request to the Rational Team Concert
change management service. Links are created between both artifacts
using link support provided by the Jazz Foundation. This same strategy
is employed when a tester in Rational Quality Manager chooses to link to
a work item in Rational Team Concert; Rational Quality Manager calls the
change management service using the OSLC specification.

OSLC Delegation (source: [OSLC Core
Specification](http://open-services.net/pub/Main/OSLCCoreSpecDRAFT/oslc-delegated.png))

This provides a powerful and resilient integration which supports
independent evolution of the products. The URL integrating the two tools
can stay the same with each new upgrade, and changes can be made to the
user interface (coming from the provider application) without
compromising the consumers integration. The delegating UI is helpful to
the end user but it is even more helpful to a developer. Without
delegating the UI the product developers would have to have in-depth
knowledge about how to create a particular artifact. For example,
creating a defect would require knowing which of the attributes are
required and this would require knowledge about the used process and so
on. This would increase the coupling between the products and increased
coupling has a negative impact on independent evolution. This
demonstrates two important architectural decisions to delegate complex
capabilities to the provider and provide a simple way to discover a
resource. Delegating the UI results in a coarse grained coupling only,
and it keeps the barrier of entry low for existing products.

The above diagram illustrates the associations between the core assets
of the Rational solution for CLM. The intra-product relationships (the
relationships that exist within a lifecycle application) are represented
by a dashed line, and the inter-application relationships (the
relationships that exist across applications) are represented by a solid
line. Those in blue were added in the CLM 2011 release. A few examples
of these relationships are listed here. However, the reader should study
the diagram to understand all of the relationships that exist.

An example of an intra-application relationship in the Requirements
Management application (RRC) is that of a Requirement to a Collection of
requirements. A requirement may be of many types, such as, declarative,
use-case, storyboard, UI sketch, etc. A collection is a logical grouping
of these requirements. Therefore, an analyst may choose to bundle a
collection of requirements that apply to a specific release, or possibly
group requirements that affect a specific bug-fix, allowing the team to
know exactly what is to be implemented.

Another example is the relationship between a Test Plan and Test Cases
in the Quality Management application (RQM). Test Plans define the
overall plan for a testing effort, and they generally include a number
of Test Cases that perform the various tests against the application.
Similarly, Test Cases are related to Test Executions, which in-turn
generate (and hence are related to) Test Results.

Lastly, the Change and Configuration Management application (RTC) also
has a number of intra-application relationships. For example, when doing
iterative development it is important to have a high-level Plan for a
release (such as Version 1.0) and several iteration Plans (Sprint 1,
Sprint 2, etc.), that identify the work to be done in each iteration,
and will be executed against the Release Plan, thus the Plan
relationship to itself in the diagram.

The inter-application relationships shown by the solid lines illustrate
the relationships between the applications. These relationships provide
for the Collaborative Lifecycle Management integrations.

An example of this is the relationship between a Requirements Collection
in RM and a Release Plan in CCM. The Requirements Collection defines the
requirements to be implemented in the release, and the Release Plan
indicates the work that needs to be done in order to implement the
appropriate requirements. In this instance, the Requirements Collection
is said to be implemented by the Release Plan, and the Release Plan
implements the Requirements Collection.

Similarly, the Requirements Collection may be linked to a Test Plan in
QM, which allows the quality team to ensure they are testing the
appropriate requirements. In this instance, the Requirements Collection
is said to be validated by the Test Plan and the Test Plan validates the
Requirements Collection.

To complete the traceability, Release Plans in CCM may be linked to Test
Plans in QM, such that RQM tests the work being performed per the
Release Plan.

The Jazz Architecture has enabled a diverse ecosystem of third party
tools to emerge based on the available interfaces. The [Jazz
Integrations Dashboard](https://jazz.net/extend/integrations/) provides
a list of all those IBM Business Partners and other vendors providing
value added integrations to the Rational solution for CLM. Further, the
internal, Jazz [Integration Management
Dashboard](https://jazzdev.torolab.ibm.com:9443/jazz/web/projects/Jazz Platform#action=com.ibm.team.dashboard.viewDashboard&team=Open20Integrations&tab=_8)
describes the work by the Gearbox team to develop additional
integrations. Lastly, the IBM Rational Integration Engineering Team has
developed a number of [salable commercial
assets](http://w3.ibm.com/software/xl/portal/content?synKey=H129094D43445O88)
(integrations, extensions, utilities, etc.) that are available to use
with customers.

## Strengths

The strengths for the Rational solution for CLM are primarily addressed
collectively by looking at the current state of the Jazz Team Server and
the individual products use of Jazz:

-   **Common technology and server platform:** The Rational solution for
    CLM constitutes products that are based on a common technology
    platform called Jazz. The CLM products all run on top of a Jazz Team
    Server and use Jazz Foundation Services. This provides the products
    with a basis for deploying, managing, and integrating separate
    deployments of products based on Jazz in a common way.

<!-- -->

-   **Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration framework:** The Jazz
    Team Server that the core CLM products run on implement OSLC as a
    means for integrating and communicating with each other. This
    provides a common way for sharing, integrating, and tracing assets
    across the products that would otherwise not be possible. For
    example, work item queries in Rational Team Concert can be hosted on
    a dashboard in Rational Quality Manager. This is also true of
    products that are not Jazz based but implement the OSLC
    specification. For example, Rational ClearQuest (v7.1.0.2 and newer)
    implements the OSLC 2.0 Change Management specification allowing it
    to share and integrate change management data bi-directionally with
    other tools that also support this specification, like Rational Team
    Concert. IBM has committed to providing and improving product
    integrations between the Jazz based CLM products and the broader
    portfolio of products. Additionally, many IBM Business Partners and
    market leading software products are supporting OSLC to increase
    their product interoperability with these offerings and the industry
    as a whole.

<!-- -->

-   **Token licensing support:** The Rational solution for CLM supports
    a token licensing model enabling customers to flexibly use whichever
    token supported product in Rational they need at any given point in
    time. Tokens are a layer of abstraction above products allowing
    customers to flexibly shift their investment from one product or
    domain to another without having to make product by product license
    purchases that are mutually exclusive.

<!-- -->

-   **Open commercial development:** The Rational solution for CLM is
    developed by IBM employees fully committed to making a highly
    innovative offering. However, the Rational solution for CLM is
    developed openly in the community on Jazz.net. Customers can see the
    ongoing work and plans, status, enhancements, and defects from IBM
    as well as those submitted by others. Additionally, builds of the
    milestone, beta, and release candidate versions of the products are
    incrementally provided for anyone registered (free) to try out. The
    source code for these products is also available on Jazz.net as well
    as incubator/prototype offerings being explored. Unlike an open
    source project, the software that goes into the releases is solely
    developed by IBM and is subject to strict quality assurance and
    management.

<!-- -->

-   **Broad and deep lifecycle management solution portfolio:** The
    Rational solution for CLM has a broad scope covering all major
    lifecycle management activities and also is deep providing best in
    class support for domain/role specific activities in the software
    development lifecycle. This is supported, integrated, and provided
    completely from IBM Rational reducing the overhead in managing and
    supporting the solution while assuring greater overall quality and
    reducing the investment risk in the solution.

<!-- -->

-   **Scalability and globally distributed development support:** The
    Rational solution for CLM has been optimized to scale and support
    hundreds and even thousands of users. Additionally, it uses
    http/https as its communication protocol and has been optimized for
    usage over wide area networks enabling it to support distributed
    users and groups from multiple locations while preserving the
    intended user experience.

<!-- -->

-   **Rich web 2.0 user experience:** The Rational solution for CLM
    provides a rich web client experience with features such as drag and
    drop, rich hovers, etc. The web client is considered a first class
    client that enables customers to flexibly access and use the product
    without having to worry about installing software or compatibility.
    It supports industry leading browsers including Microsoft Internet
    Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.

<!-- -->

-   **Broad platform support:** The Rational solution for CLM has the
    broadest platform support in the industry today as described in the
    [CLM System
    Requirements](DeploymentInstallingUpgradingAndMigrating).

<!-- -->

-   **Enterprise class entitlements included with paid licenses:**
    Customers are entitled to use WebSphere Application Server, DB2, and
    Cognos for their CLM deployments. Cognos adds development
    intelligence style reporting to the Rational solution for CLM.

## Complementary products

Jazz enables the Rational solution for CLM to be open and complement an
existing customers software stack, both Rational and non Rational
offerings via OSLC. It should be noted that the products identified in
the "IBM Product Alternatives" section can also be considered
complementary if a customer already owns these products or requires
them. All of these "Product Alternatives" include one or more
integrations to the Rational solution for CLM. However, there are
notable Rational products that directly complement the core Rational
solution for CLM with minimal to no overlap as identified here. A
customer-facing [Extend your
tools](https://jazz.net/extend/integrations/) page has been created that
details all the integrations to Jazz and the Rational solution for CLM.
There include native IBM supported integrations planned to non-IBM based
products including HP Quality Center, Atlassian Jira, and open source
Git.

    author, tailor, configure, and publish process descriptions. RMC
    process descriptions provide the human readable guidance team
    members need to work together effectively and efficiently as a team.
    RTC process templates provide the machine readable rules that
    configure the tool to support your process. Together, RMC and RTC
    provide a powerful solution for process management, process
    enactment, and measured capability improvement. The Rational
    solution for CLM includes practices and processes in RMC, which
    require an RMC reader license to access; to tailor those, a full

TOC{title="Page contents"}

New configuration management capabilities were introduced in the IBM
Rational solution for Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM) 6.0.0 and
the associated IBM Internet of Things Continuous Engineering (IoT CE )
solution, extending the ability to version artifacts and define streams
and baselines to the requirements and quality management domains. This
article captures practices for clients planning to adopt these new
capabilities, based on IBM and client experiences to date. (Note: This
article does not address source code configuration management (SCM),
which has already evolved its own set of practices over a longer period
of very broad use.)

A growing series of articles on Jazz.net provides a deeper exploration
of practices around specific aspects of configuration management. Find
the complete list of available articles in [CLM Usage Model Best
Practices: Global Configuration
Management](CLMUsageModelBestPractices#Global_Configuration_Management).

## General adoption guidance

As you plan your adoption, it's important to consider your objectives
and current processes, as well as these practices. Evaluate the
capabilities in the context of end-to-end scenarios for your
organization, including:

-   [Component architecture and configuration
    strategy](#ComponentsConfigurations)
-   [Stream strategy](#StreamStrategy), including baseline creation,
    cross-stream delivery
-   Change management, especially with respect to [change
    sets](#UseExplicitChangeSets)
-   [Reporting needs](#ReportingOnVersionedArtifacts)
-   [Integrations](#PlanForIntegrations) with other applications
-   [Roles and permissions and other process aspects](#GeneralProcess)

Validate and refine your scenarios and processes in pilot projects,
considering both new and existing projects. Identify any gaps and
workarounds required. Involve IBM subject matter experts as you define
your strategy and implementation plans.

Ensure that you allocate appropriate infrastructure to support
configuration management, including a separate server for the Lifecycle
Query Engine (LQE) application. For guidance on deployment topologies
and sizings, see [Deployment Planning](DeploymentPlanningAndDesign), and
in particular [CLM Sizing Strategy](CLMSizingStrategy60) and [LQE Best
Practices](LifecycleQueryEngineBestPractices).

Refer also to the Jazz.net article [CLM configuration management:
Adoption guidance and
practices](https://jazz.net/library/article/90557), which provides
additional guidance.

## Suggested best practices

The following sections provide guidance on different topics of
consideration for adoption planning. These practices are based on
experiences of clients who have already adopted configuration
management. \#ComponentsConfigurations

### Defining components and configurations

At its simplest, a component is a container of artifacts. Configurations
exist at the level of a component (that is, a component has one or more
configurations). Components exist in the local applications (RM, QM, DM,
SCM) and also at a global level in the GCM application. Global
components are the basis for global configurations, which group the
"local" configurations from the individual application components, and
also other global configurations, to create hierarchical representations
of your subsystems, systems, and offerings.

In versions 6.0.0 through 6.0.2, each RM, QM, or DM project area
represented a single component. As of version 6.0.3, you can optionally
subdivide RM and QM project areas into smaller components, each with its
own set of artifacts; each component has its own streams and baselines.
Rhapsody Model Management (RMM) added support for components in version
6.0.5.

Be aware of the following limitations related to components in 6.0.3 and
later:

-   To link between artifacts in different components, both component
    configurations must be included in the same global configuration.
-   You can link between RM components, and RM and QM components, but
    you cannot link between individual QM components. To reuse an
    artifact across QM components, you must create a new copy.
-   If two RM components each contain a version of the same artifact,
    you cannot include both components in a single global configuration,
    because it would introduce version skew. When you clone artifacts
    across components, you create a new version of the same source
    artifact in the target component; ensure that you will not include
    both source and target components in the same configuration. If you
    must include both components in a configuration, copy the artifact
    instead of cloning it: copying creates a new artifact instead of a
    new version.
-   Configuration comparisons and change delivery or merge operations
    occur in the context of a specific component. Once you subdivide an
    existing project area into smaller components, you will not be able
    to compare to baselines or streams on the original project area
    component, or deliver changes across component boundaries.

As you plan and implement your component strategy:

-   [Balance granularity and complexity in defining components,
    especially when creating multiple components in a project
    area](#GranularityVsComplexity)
-   [Avoid very deep hierarchies of global components and
    configurations](#AvoidDeepGCHierarchies)
-   [Use naming conventions for identification and
    differentiation](#NamingConventions)
-   [Define and use a tagging taxonomy for global components and
    configurations](#GCTagTaxonomy)
-   [Consider custom attributes on global configurations where
    appropriate](#GCCustomAttributes)
-   [Use a consistent type system across project areas, components, and
    streams within a domain](#ConsistentTypeSystem)
-   [Define external RDF URIs for types, attributes, enumeration
    values](#ExternalRDFURIs)

Read the article [CLM configuration management: Defining your component
strategy](https://jazz.net/library/article/90573) on Jazz.net for
additional guidance on component strategy. \#GranularityVsComplexity

#### Balance granularity and complexity in defining components, especially when creating multiple components in a project area [balance-granularity-and-complexity-in-defining-components-especially-when-creating-multiple-components-in-a-project-area]

In general, components should reflect the logical hierarchy of your
systems or applications. As of 6.0.3, you can subdivide RM and QM
project areas into multiple smaller components, providing flexibility to
evolve, baseline, and reuse those components separately.

However, to link across components, you need a global configuration. A
configuration lead must maintain the global configurations and ensure
the correct streams or baselines for each component are included in the
appropriate global streams or baselines, so the correct artifact
versions remain together. As the number of individual components
increase, managing the variations and maintaining currency becomes more
challenging.

As you define your components, consider:

-   Reuse and variance. What logical components are reused across
    multiple versions or variants of your offerings? These logical
    components are a good starting point for your global components and
    the components in your project areas.
-   Lifecycle cadence. Are there sets of artifacts that evolve and
    mature on a different timeline from others? You can baseline a
    component separately, allowing you to freeze that set of artifacts
    while the artifacts in other components are still evolving.
-   Ownership. Ownership is not likely a sole determining factor;
    however, one might expect a component to be owned by one or a small
    number of teams, as opposed to multiple teams owning multiple
    artifacts over a variety of components.
-   Relationships and links between artifacts. Links between artifacts
    don't always mean they belong in the same component; you can link
    across components (with some limitations - see below). However, if
    artifacts are interrelated and evolve in tandem, consider whether
    they should be grouped together.

\#AvoidDeepGCHierarchies

#### Avoid very deep hierarchies of global components and configurations [avoid-very-deep-hierarchies-of-global-components-and-configurations]

Related to the previous point, deep global configuration hierarchies
require additional effort to maintain over time. Where practical, aim
for a hierarchy with 3 to 5 levels. If the complexity of your systems or
offerings requires a deeper hierarchy, plan for how your configuration
leads will manage the hierarchy and configuration variation over time.
With deeper hierarchies, ensuring appropriate naming and tagging
conventions becomes even more important.

If you do have deeper or more complex global configuration hierarchies,
plan carefully how to use the available automation to generate new
global baselines or new streams from baselines in the hierarchy. From
the highest level in the hierarchy, you can generate a global baseline
that creates new baselines in every global and local contribution in the
hierarchy. You can also select multiple baselines that contribute to the
global configuration and create new streams for them. Either of these
operations can place high demand on the local applications to create the
required baselines or streams. For deeper hierarchies, consider starting
at a lower level in the hierarchy and use the automation incrementally,
creating the new baselines or streams in smaller batches. If the
operation still impacts a significant number of local configurations,
perform it when application usage is light. Alternatively, create local
baselines or streams in the local applications first, then replace them
in the respective global configurations. \#NamingConventions ----++++!
Use naming conventions for identification and differentiation Naming
conventions are very important for configurations, streams, baselines,
and also change sets. They make it easier for practitioners to
understand what they are working on, and for configuration leads to
understand relationships as well as differentiate the configurations
based on date, variant, and so on.

For components, use names that are meaningful to the practitioners and
configuration leads. Where appropriate, make the names similar between
local and global components so it's easy to determine relationships.
(For example, if a global component groups contributions from a single
RM and a single QM component, use similar names for all three so it's
clear they go together).

For configurations, make the "unit of variance" clear, whether that is
geographical, time-based, milestone-based, and so on. There isn't a
single right answer, it depends on your process and usage model. You
might also choose to use custom attributes or tags to indicate variance
between configurations; ensure that your choices still support the
configuration lead's tasks (for example, and don't require them to check
the attributes for multiple configurations with the same name to
determine which is the one they need).

Consider the length of the name, and where the unique part of the
identifier appears. In some parts of the UI, long component and
configuration names might get truncated; for example, long component
names might be truncated in the application title banner. If the names
differ only in the last few characters, users might have difficulty
differentiating between them. \#GCTagTaxonomy ----++++! Define and use a
tagging taxonomy for global components and configurations The GCM
application currently displays global components as a flat list, which
can be challenging to navigate if you have many components. Define a
tagging taxonomy to classify your components in a way that's meaningful
to your organization; that might be based on the level of decomposition
(base, subsystem, system), geography, model year, or other values. You
can then use those tags to filter and search for the appropriate global
components, as well as in JRS reports on components.

You can also add tags to global configurations in the GCM application.
Typically you would want a different taxonomy than for your global
components, to identify them based on the variation points and so on. As
you define usage scenarios for finding, managing, and reporting on
global configurations and components, consider the taxonomy that
supports those use cases.

Note: Currently, you cannot add tags to local configurations.
\#GCCustomAttributes ----++++! Consider custom attributes on global
configurations where appropriate In the GCM application, like the RM
application, you can define custom attributes and attribute values to
assign to global components and configurations. This provides another
way to identify or classify configurations in ways that are meaningful
to your organization. You can also use the custom attributes in reports.
Using the Branch attribute is not recommended at this time, as it might
be used in future for automated selection, with rules yet to be
determined.

Note: Currently, you cannot define custom attributes for local
configurations. To include custom attributes in your reports, ensure you
are reporting on a global component and its global configurations.
\#ConsistentTypeSystem ----++++! Use a consistent type system across
project areas, components, and streams within a domain To enable
cloning, linking, and reporting on artifacts across project areas and
components, you need consistent types defined across those projects and
components. This is particularly important in the RM domain, where type
systems are specific to a project area, or after 6.0.3, to a component
within the project area. In QM projects, you can also define custom
attributes, which apply only within that project area (and to any
components it contains), and category values as well.

Also ensure your type system is also consistent across streams for any
given component. Changing the types for one stream and not another can
cause issues when you have to deliver or merge changes across streams.
Where you truly need to vary the type system between components or
streams, carefully plan how you will deliver changes to the types where
necessary, and how to deliver across streams where the types don't
match.

When defining custom link types in RM projects, ensure that they are
defined with consistent labels for both directions in all projects or
components and all configurations. If you define the same custom link
differently in two places, for example "Details/Detailed By" in one and
"Detailed By/Details" in another, or change the direction labels in a
configuration that already has baselines, the inconsistent metadata will
cause problems with reporting. If this occurs, contact IBM Support for
assistance.

To keep your type systems consistent, define and use templates when you
create new project areas and components. In RM projects, you can also
import a type system from an existing project area or component into
another. Read the Jazz.net article [Maintaining your RM type system in a
configuration management
environment](https://jazz.net/library/article/92352) and the subsequent
articles it references for more details on type system maintenance.

\#ExternalRDFURIs ----++++! Define external RDF URIs for types,
attributes, enumeration values It's also important to define RDF URIs
for attributes, types, link types, and enumeration values defined in
your project areas and components, especially where these are shared or
common. Use the same URI for all equivalent resources; for example,
define the same RDF URI for the "Satisfies" relationship in every RM
project area or component. For another example, if you have the same
Test Plan categories across QM projects or components, define the same
RDF URI for equivalent categories. Ideally, define the URIs in your
project area or component templates, so they are automatically included
for new project areas or components created with that template.

Cloning across components is dependent only on the consistent type
system. However, for RM projects, cross-component and cross-project
links will not work unless the link types and RDF URIs are defined
consistently across both source and target.

RDF URIs also make cross-component and cross-project reporting much
easier, because Report Builder can use them to consolidate types,
attributes, and values. If you are reporting across projects and do not
use RDF URIs to express equivalence, you will see attributes or values
for each individual RM component or project area, even if their names
are the same; similarly, you will see separate categories and custom
attributes for each QM project area that defines them.

Avoid making changes to existing URIs. If you change a URI, but have
some configurations that use the original URI (such as baselines or
other components), the inconsistent metadata will cause problems in
reporting. If this occurs, or if you have a strong business need to make
changes, contact IBM Support for assistance. \#StreamStrategy

### Defining your stream strategy

Your stream strategy encompasses a number of aspects:

-   The main stream or streams that you will use
-   How you deliver changes to your working stream and across streams if
    required
-   When and how you take baselines, at both local and global levels
-   When to branch a stream
-   When to archive a configuration

Some practices to keep in mind as you establish your stream strategy:

-   [Define the simplest stream strategy that can meet your
    needs](#KeepStreamsSimple)
    -   [Branch streams only when you need them](#BranchingStreams)
-   [Use explicit change sets where possible, with meaningful naming
    conventions](#UseExplicitChangeSets)
    -   [Define the granularity of your change
        sets](#ChangeSetGranularity)
    -   [Define permissions for change sets](#ChangeSetPermissions)

        system](#LinkChangeSetstoWorkItems)
    -   [Deliver DM change sets with the Rhapsody client
        ](#DeliverDMChangesWithRhapsodyClient)
    -   [Use other capabilities to manage QM
        changes](#ManageQMChangeNoCS)
-   [Deliver changes early and often ](#DeliverEarlyAndOften)
-   [Minimize cross-stream deliveries to reduce merge
    conflicts](#MinimizeCrossStreamDeliveries)

    -   [Take baselines often](#TakeFrequentBaselines)
    -   [Use baseline staging streams only for assembling global
        baselines](#BaselineStagingStreamUsage)
-   [Archive configurations and components when you no longer need
    them](#ArchiveConfigurations)

Read the article [CLM configuration management: Patterns for stream
usage](https://jazz.net/library/article/90581) on Jazz.net for
additional guidance on choosing your stream strategy. Additional
articles describe common stream usage patterns in more detail:

-   [CLM configuration management: Single stream
    strategy](https://jazz.net/library/article/90591)
-   [CLM configuration management: Multistream variant
    strategy](https://jazz.net/library/article/90607)
-   [CLM configuration management: Multistream concurrent release
    development strategy](https://jazz.net/library/article/91004)

\#KeepStreamsSimple ----++++! Define the simplest stream strategy that
can meet your needs In general, define the simplest stream strategy with
the fewest number of streams that meets your needs. As the number of
streams increases, so does the effort associated with differentiating,
managing, and delivering change across them.

Some clients work with a single ongoing stream, where they deliver
change over time and take baselines to capture the state at particular
milestones. Others maintain a production stream, delivering changes
first into an integration stream and then at defined intervals into
production. Others require more than one integration stream to support
separate projects working in parallel that must remain isolated. In some
cases, that isolation can be handled with change sets.

It's important to work through your own process and understand your
organization's needs to decide the best strategy for you. Start your
planning with the expectation of having a single stream, and then expand
as you identify the need. Consider and plan for exceptional
circumstances, but optimize for the typical and daily usage patterns.

Here are two examples of many possible stream strategies:

***Single ongoing stream with change sets and baselines*** Each project
area or component has a single stream. Practitioners create change sets
to deliver changes to the stream. A change set might be at the level of
a feature, or a project, depending on the organization and defined
scope. Any conflicts are resolved at change set delivery. Take baselines
to capture the state at specific milestones (e.g. iterations, releases).
Note: you might also choose to take a baseline after each change set
delivery, as described \[\[#TakeFrequentBaselines\]\[in the later
section on baseline strategy\].

This is the simplest strategy. It requires no cross-stream deliveries.
However, it can be limiting if many teams must work in parallel, on
different cadences, with interleaved dependencies. Note: The QM
application does not yet support change sets. For QM streams, you can
make changes directly to the stream and take baselines after each
substantive change.

Read the article [CLM configuration management: Single stream
strategy](https://jazz.net/library/article/90591) on Jazz.net for a more
detailed description of this strategy. ***Production and integration
streams, with separate release streams*** One main stream (trunk)
represents the final production level. A parallel integration stream
mirrors the main stream. Project or release work happens in a dedicated
stream branched from the main stream; practitioners deliver changes to
those dedicated streams. At defined intervals, project streams deliver
their work to the integration stream. At defined intervals, changes from
the integration stream are delivered to the main stream. Use baselines
on all streams to capture content at specific milestones.

This strategy allows larger teams to work in parallel, using smaller
change sets, and still be isolated from other teams' work. It can also
provide tighter control over the production stream, since individual
teams do not deliver there directly. It also requires greater
coordination and management, and the cross-stream deliveries from
multiple streams increase the potential for conflicts. There might also
be a need to refresh project streams if they depend on deliveries from
other streams that happen after the original branching.

Read the articles [CLM configuration management: Multistream concurrent
release development strategy](https://jazz.net/library/article/91004)
and [CLM configuration management: Multistream variant
strategy](https://jazz.net/library/article/90607) for more details on
common multistream strategies. \#BranchingStreams ----+++++! Branch
streams only when you need them Branch streams only as needed, and only
when you are ready to start working in them, to ensure they reflect the
most current artifacts in the parent stream. ----+++++! Avoid deleting
versioned artifacts in multi-stream environments Avoid deleting
versioned artifacts in streams where there is a possibility of future
cross-stream deliveries; deleted artifacts can impact dependencies and
cause problems with future deliveries both into and out of the stream
where they were deleted. If you need to indicate artifacts are not
relevant to a certain configuration, alternative approaches could
include changing the artifact state to an appropriate value, or moving
the artifact to a special folder. \#UseExplicitChangeSets ----++++! Use
explicit change sets where possible, with meaningful naming conventions
In RM and DM applications, use explicit change sets where appropriate.
(Note: We are not addressing the SCM application, where the use of
change sets is widely known and followed; the QM application does not
yet provide change sets.) With explicit change sets, you can group
related changes together, provide a meaningful name to describe those
changes, and link the change set to a change request in a change
management system -- all of which help you to understand what changes
were made and why, and to easily deliver those changes to another stream
if needed. Both RM and DM applications provide an option to mandate
change sets, set at the individual stream level. Define a naming
convention that will help you identify change sets and relationships
between change sets.

If you don't need to group or track changes, or deliver across streams,
you might not need explicit change sets. Examples might include the
initial set of work on a new project, or for a single requirements
stream with no need for cross-stream delivery or associating changes to
a particular work request. Ensure that you consider your process across
the lifecycle to determine when explicit change sets are and are not
needed. \#ChangeSetGranularity ----+++++! Define the granularity and
desired scope of your change sets Decide the granularity, size, and
expected duration for RM and DM change sets. For example, do you have
one change set per change request, per feature, per project? How long
can a change set remain open? You might also decide to limit change sets
based on number of artifacts modified. Use naming conventions to express
the content of your change, and ensure it addresses the potential to
have multiple related change sets. \#ChangeSetPermissions ----+++++!
Define permissions for change sets Define who has permission to create
and deliver change sets. Some clients have very tight control over who
can open a change set; others assign permission to any team member. In
RM, you can also permit a user to deliver change sets for other users;
you might choose to have a team focal point responsible for delivering
all the change sets for the team, along with resolving any conflicts.
Refer to [Defining Roles and Permissions](#RolesAndPermissions) for more
details on permissions. \#LinkChangeSetstoWorkItems ----+++++! Link
change sets to change requests in your change mangement system If you
use a change management system (like Rational Team Concert), link your
change sets to work items to establish traceability from the request to
the actual changes. This is particularly useful if you have multiple
related change sets, to document the scope of change and also provide a
reference for the change sets needed to propagate the change to another
stream if required. You can also choose to use the approval process in
the change management application, and to mandate change request
approval before the change set can be delivered.
\#DeliverDMChangesWithRhapsodyClient ----+++++! Deliver DM change sets
with the Rhapsody client You can deliver change sets through the DM web
client, but you are not able to view and compare the changes at
delivery. Use the Rhapsody client for a richer set of compare and merge
capabilities. \#ManagingQMChangeNoCS ----+++++! Use other capabilities
in QM to manage change QM does not yet support change sets. To manage
change in QM projects:

-   Take frequent baselines so you can easily restore the baseline or
    merge a previous version of an artifact.
-   Limit the ability to merge and restore across streams by assigning
    permissions to a small number of individuals.
-   As of 6.0.3, you can use the artifact version tree in QM to
    understand how a specific artifact has evolved and its versions.
-   Use link validity to understand requirements change.
-   Consider documenting or reporting on changes associated with a
    particular change request.

\#DeliverEarlyAndOften

#### Deliver changes early and often Incremental changes tend to be easier to address than very large merge operations. Ideally, change sets are relatively small for faster delivery, and delivered quickly, to reduce the potential for conflict with other change sets that might be underway at the same time. At this point in time, you can't easily identify conflicting changes until you deliver them. (The change set will show non-conflicting changes made to the parent stream; however, with the exception of tags, if the artifact changes in both the change set and the parent stream, the change set will not reflect the parent's changes). [deliver-changes-early-and-often-incremental-changes-tend-to-be-easier-to-address-than-very-large-merge-operations.-ideally-change-sets-are-relatively-small-for-faster-delivery-and-delivered-quickly-to-reduce-the-potential-for-conflict-with-other-change-sets-that-might-be-underway-at-the-same-time.-at-this-point-in-time-you-cant-easily-identify-conflicting-changes-until-you-deliver-them.-the-change-set-will-show-non-conflicting-changes-made-to-the-parent-stream-however-with-the-exception-of-tags-if-the-artifact-changes-in-both-the-change-set-and-the-parent-stream-the-change-set-will-not-reflect-the-parents-changes.]

For some clients, small incremental change sets might not be
appropriate. If you require larger change sets that remain open for a
long period of time, determine how to address the need to synchronize
your change set with changes that happen to the parent stream between
the time you open your change set and the delivery. In some cases,
clients choose to open a new change set on the current stream and
re-implement their changes to avoid conflicts.

If users will select the "automatic" change set delivery in RM, also
define what rules they need to follow for conflict resolution; for
example, should users always resolve conflicts manually, or are there
certain attributes that should usually default to source or target.
There is also some ability to script delivery of change sets.
\#MinimizeCrossStreamDeliveries

#### Minimize cross-stream deliveries to reduce merge conflicts [minimize-cross-stream-deliveries-to-reduce-merge-conflicts]

Minimize cross-stream deliveries, especially across multiple streams,
which increase the likelihood of merge conflicts. At this time, there is
no easy way to detect conflicting changes that happen in parallel
streams, other than by a compare or delivery operation.

Where you do need to deliver across streams, determine based on your
process and needs:

-   When to use a "deliver" (source pushes to target) or "accept"
    (target pulls from source) approach in RM and DM (QM always starts a
    merge from the target). Accepting changes might provide greater
    control and allow a "gatekeeper" kind of approach to the target
    stream.
-   When to use a "cascade" (stream A to B to C) or "broadcast" (stream
    A to B, A to C) approach; both are valid, depending on your usage
    model and the stream hierarchy. If you will need to resolve the same
    merge conflict in each stream, you might choose the "cascade"
    approach, to complete the merge once and not repeat it. If a main
    stream changes, a "broadcast" approach to all children might be more
    appropriate.
-   Who will complete the delivery. Consider centralizing
    responsibilities for cross-stream merging to a particular team or
    individual who can become expert in the process.

The Jazz.net article [Configuration management: Delivering across
streams in Rational Quality
Manager](https://jazz.net/library/article/92731) provides additional
guidance on merging across QM streams. \#BaselineStrategy ----++++!
Define a baseline strategy You can take baselines in the individual
applications for a particular configuration (component). Define when you
need to take baselines for individual components, who is responsible for
doing so, and the naming convention to use so you can easily identify
the baseline.

You also take baselines for global configurations to capture a holistic
snapshot of your global components, systems, and offerings. Global
baselines include baselines for each of the local configurations they
contain. Again, decide when to take global baselines, who is
responsible, and naming conventions to use. Also decide whether and when
to use the automated recursion or manual staging methods to create the
global baseline:

-   Automated recursion: In a global configuration, you can
    automatically generate a baseline for all of the local
    configurations that appear in its hierarchy, in any of the
    applications (GCM, RM, DM, QM, SCM). This is a convenient and
    relatively quick way to create a global baseline. However, it
    assumes that each contributed configuration is in an appropriate
    state to be baselined. In addition, it places demand on the
    individual applications; if the hierarchy is deep or contains many
    local configurations, the load could impact application performance.
    Ensure that you complete such operations during periods of light
    usage, or consider an incremental approach and create baselines at
    lower levels of the hierarchy that you can then manually add to the
    higher-level global configuration. See [Avoid very deep hiearchies
    of global components and configurations](#AvoidDeepGCHierarchies)
    for additional details.
-   Manual staging: You can also stage a baseline for a global
    configuration, and manually replace each contribution with a
    baseline. This method can be more time-consuming for the
    configuration lead, especially for large or deep configurations. It
    provides more control at the local application level to take
    baselines asynchronously and then provide them for global
    configuration use. Your strategy and naming conventions should
    address how a global configuration lead would know which local
    baselines to choose. Note: Baseline staging streams are intended
    only for assembling global baselines, not for engineering teams to
    perform work; see [Use baseline staging streams only for assembling
    global baselines](#BaselineStagingStreamUsage) for more details.

Both of these approaches are valid, and you might choose to use either
or a combination of both to address your needs. \#TakeFrequentBaselines
----+++++! Take baselines as often as is practical For the local
applications, baselines are not expensive to take or to store. At this
time, neither RM nor QM applications provide the ability to roll back
changes; you can use baselines as an alternative to rollback.

However, too many baselines can affect reporting performance, as well as
usability when selecting the configuration context. As you determine
your baseline frequency, ensure that you are not taking them more often
than necessary, and that you [archive baselines](#ArchiveConfigurations)
that are no longer needed.

In QM, take baselines after what constitutes a substantive change, for
example, review or approval completion. You can merge changes from the
baseline into the current stream, or restore the baseline and revert the
entire stream to that previous state (which could impact other changes
made since that baseline). Typically only a few users would have
[permission](#RolesAndPermissions) to complete those actions.
\#BaselineStagingStreamUsage ----+++++! Use baseline staging streams
only for assembling global baselines, not as working stabilization
streams The baseline staging stream is a special kind of global
configuration. It is intended for use by Configuration Leads who need to
create a global baseline by manually replacing the global
configuration's stream contributions.

As described in [Define a baseline strategy](#BaselineStrategy), it's
not always feasible to use automatic recursion to baseline a global
configuration and all of its contributions at once. The alternative is
to create a baseline staging stream, where the Configuration Lead can
then assemble the appropriate contribution baselines, coordinating with
teams as needed. Once they have replaced all stream contributions, the
Lead can fully commit the global baseline.

While the baseline staging stream is technically mutable, it is **not**
intended to be used as a working context; engineering teams should never
make changes in the context of a baseline staging stream. You might
still set your configuration context to a baseline staging stream for
example, to verify that the correct baselines have been assembled and
the cross-application links resolve as expected. However, the only type
of change that should occur in a baseline staging stream is to replace a
stream contribution with a corresponding baseline.

If you need working streams for controlled stabilization prior to a
milestone or release, use a normal global configuration stream and plan
for that in your stream strategy. If appropriate, you can assign streams
to specific team areas to restrict its visibility or usage.

Configuration Leads might also use a baseline staging stream if they
realize an existing global baseline includes a small number of incorrect
contributions. In that scenario, instead of starting a new global
baseline from the original global configuration, the Configuration Lead
can create a baseline staging stream from the global baseline,
substitute the correct baseline contributions, and commit the new global
baseline. Again, the engineering teams would make any changes in the
context of a working global configuration; the only changes in the
baseline staging stream are to substitute new baseline contributions for
the existing ones. \#ArchiveConfigurations ----+++++! Archive
configurations and components when you no longer need them Over time,
the list of configurations can become quite long, especially if you are
taking frequent baselines. A very large number of configurations can
impact reporting performance, as well as impact usability when selecting
a configuration context for reporting, comparison, cross-stream
delivery, and so on.

Periodically review the list of baselines to determine which are no
longer required; for example, once you pass a release milestone, you
might archive the interim baselines you took in between milestones. Also
review the streams for your components, and archive those that have no
ongoing work and are not a flow target for other streams.

You can also archive an entire component, which archives all the
configurations associated with that component. For example, if you have
reorganized your project area into multiple components, you can
eventually archive the original component as obsolete.

You can archive and restore configurations and components at both the
local and global level. You cannot archive a local configuration if
other configurations created from it are still active. Archived global
configurations still appear in other global configurations that
reference them, although they are not included in search and filter
results. The Knowledge Center provides more details on archiving [global
configurations](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYMRC_6.0.3/com.ibm.rational.gcapp.doc/topics/c_about_archived_config_comp.html)
and [local
configurations](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYMRC_6.0.3/com.ibm.jazz.vvc.doc/topics/t_config_arch.html).
\#ReportingOnVersionedArtifacts

### Reporting on versioned artifacts

Reports and dashboard widgets that use the data warehouse will not work
for versioned artifacts. For interactive reports on versioned artifacts,
you need to use the Lifecycle Query Engine (LQE) data source and
possibly rewrite a number of existing reports to use LQE. As part of
your adoption planning, identify and prioritize the reports you need,
and how you might obtain them. Plan and stage your reporting adoption
along with the broader adoption, building reports as part of your
evaluation and pilot activities.

-   [Start by leveraging the reporting options that are easiest to
    adopt](#LowEffortOptions)
-   [Follow recommended practices for reporting in
    general](#GeneralReportingBPs)
-   [Use consistent type systems with external URIs](#UseExternalURIs)
-   [For reusable reports, avoid limiting
    scope](#GenericCrossProjectReports)
-   [Use custom SPARQL only when absolutely
    necessary](#LimitCustomSPARQL)

For guidance on LQE deployment, administration, and troubleshooting, as
well as other reporting topics, see the [JRS
wiki](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/JazzReportingService).
\#LowEffortOptions

#### Start by leveraging the reporting options that are easiest to adopt [start-by-leveraging-the-reporting-options-that-are-easiest-to-adopt]

To get started, consider the reporting options that require less effort
to adopt:

-   For work-item-only reports, continue to use the data warehouse. Work
    items aren't versioned; as long as the report doesn't reference
    versioned artifacts (like requirements or tests), you can continue
    to use it.
-   Use dashboard widgets from the applications. Most applications
    provide a set of configuration-aware dashboard widgets; you can also
    build JRS reports and add those to your dashboard.
-   Generate documents. The built-in document generation continues to
    work, using the current configuration context. If you use Rational
    Publishing Engine (RPE), you can reuse existing templates by simply
    adding the configuration context to use. You can also build
    additional RPE templates and import them into the applications.
-   Prioritize and build JRS reports, starting simple. Use the [sample
    reports](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/LQEReadyToCopyReports)
    and the Report Builder tutorials to help get started.

\#GeneralReportingBPs

#### Follow recommended practices for reporting in general [follow-recommended-practices-for-reporting-in-general]

Observe general reporting best practices, as described in [JRS Report
Builder best practices](JRSReportBuilderBestPractices). Those include
scoping your queries early, instead of requesting a great deal of data
that is not really needed, and ensuring that long-running reports with
large result sets appear on secondary dashboards, not the ones that are
loaded frequently by many users. \#UseExternalURIs

#### Use consistent type systems with external URIs Previous topics described the importance of a \[\[ConsistentTypeSystem\]\[consistent type system\] using [external RDF URIs](ExternalRDFURIs) to enable cross-component and cross-project linking, cloning, and copying. Those URIs are also important for reporting, making it much easier to build reports that cross components and projects. Without the URIs, you will see a separate entry for the attribute in each individual project or component, which complicates selecting attributes as well as setting conditions. [use-consistent-type-systems-with-external-uris-previous-topics-described-the-importance-of-a-consistenttypesystemconsistent-type-system-using-external-rdf-uris-to-enable-cross-component-and-cross-project-linking-cloning-and-copying.-those-uris-are-also-important-for-reporting-making-it-much-easier-to-build-reports-that-cross-components-and-projects.-without-the-uris-you-will-see-a-separate-entry-for-the-attribute-in-each-individual-project-or-component-which-complicates-selecting-attributes-as-well-as-setting-conditions.]

If you modify URIs in different configurations (for example, make
changes when a configuration already has baselines), the inconsistent
metadata causes problems with reporting. If this occurs, contact IBM
Support for assistance. \#GenericCrossProjectReports

#### For reusable reports, avoid limiting scope In Report Builder, you can choose to limit your scope to specific project areas. When you select a project area, the options that you see for artifact types, conditions, and so on, are also limited to what is defined in that project area. Those types, attributes, and conditions might not be valid for other project areas. If you want to build a report that can be run by multiple projects, avoid limiting scope, so you see the representation across all the project areas. Defining external URIs, as described above, also makes it easier to write reports that can apply across project areas, because you have indicated their types and attributes are equivalent. [for-reusable-reports-avoid-limiting-scope-in-report-builder-you-can-choose-to-limit-your-scope-to-specific-project-areas.-when-you-select-a-project-area-the-options-that-you-see-for-artifact-types-conditions-and-so-on-are-also-limited-to-what-is-defined-in-that-project-area.-those-types-attributes-and-conditions-might-not-be-valid-for-other-project-areas.-if-you-want-to-build-a-report-that-can-be-run-by-multiple-projects-avoid-limiting-scope-so-you-see-the-representation-across-all-the-project-areas.-defining-external-uris-as-described-above-also-makes-it-easier-to-write-reports-that-can-apply-across-project-areas-because-you-have-indicated-their-types-and-attributes-are-equivalent.]

\#LimitCustomSPARQL

#### Use custom SPARQL only when absolutely necessary [use-custom-sparql-only-when-absolutely-necessary]

Report Builder generates SPARQL queries to report on data from the LQE
data source, as opposed to SQL for the data warehouse. As much as
possible, use Report Builder interactively to build your reports.
Although you can edit the queries or write custom SPARQL queries, do so
only when you cannot achieve what you need through Report Builder. Once
you edit a query, you must make all further changes directly to the
query; you won't be able to use the Report Builder UI to modify the
report, and might lose formatting and conditions you set using the UI.

If you choose to customize a SPARQL query:

-   Consider whether you could use a custom expression instead. Report
    Builder supports adding custom SPARQL expressions through the UI.
-   Create as much of the report as possible in Report Builder, and save
    a copy before making any changes to the generated query. Then edit

\#PlanForIntegrations

### Planning integrations with other applications

The CLM applications support integration with other non-CLM
applications; however, to integrate with
configuration-management-enabled project areas, those non-CLM
applications typically must provide some level of support for the OSLC
Configuration Management specification, and understand how to reference
versioned artifacts. (Note that test execution adapters are an
exception; if they integrate with RQM using the published API, RQM
manages the configuration context and the adapter does not require any
special support.)

Identify the applications with which you plan to integrate, and check
with the application provider to determine their support for
configuration management. If the application does not support
integrating with configuration-management-enabled projects, consider
potential workarounds such as import and export.

There are also a few points to consider with respect to integrations
between the CLM applications:

-   If RM or QM project areas are linked, you must enable configuration
    management in both or neither. Otherwise, links between them will
    not work correctly.
-   RTC plans and work items are not versioned, and therefore are not
    part of a configuration. However, you can associate plans and work
    items to a global configuration using the Release and link mapping
    mechanisms. See the [Knowledge
    Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYMRC_6.0.3/com.ibm.team.workitem.doc/topics/t_enabling_linking_to_versioned_artifacts.html?cm_mc_uid=96970092940914906201772&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1491331349)
    and [this short
    video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFcpLhbQ_Ak&index=7&list=PLZGO0qYNSD4WrN1Qx4f7NzJ74gkfLNDNr)
    for details on those mechanisms. The Jazz.net article [Configuring
    Rational Team Concert to establish a global configuration context
    for work items](https://jazz.net/library/article/92499) describes
    the mechanisms in greater detail and identifies potential process
    impacts to consider.

\#GeneralProcess

### Defining roles, permissions, and other process elements

Adopting configuration management also entails some changes to your
organization's definition of [roles and the associated
permissions](#RolesAndPermissions) in the various applications. Ensure
that you understand and assign the appropriate responsibilities in both
the process and the tools. Also consider additional process elements,
such as [enabling link validity](#LinkValidity). \#RolesAndPermissions
----++++! Define and assign roles and permissions related to
configuration management There are additional roles associated with
managing components and configurations. In some cases, roles are related
to specific permissions in the applications; in others, they are defined
by your process and organization. Determine who will have responsibility
and permissions to:

-   Define and maintain your component and stream strategy from an
    architectural perspective
-   Manage components, streams, and baselines - at the global level and
    for the individual applications
    -   Each application has permissions related to creating, modifying,
        and archiving components and configurations
    -   If your global configuration manager will use the GCM automation
        to create streams and baselines in the local applications, s/he
        needs permission in the local application as well
-   Manage personal streams in the GCM application
-   Create and deliver change sets, including delivery for others
    -   Applications that support change sets provide related
        permissions
-   Approve change set delivery (if you mandate linking change sets to
    approved change requests)
-   Deliver or merge changes across streams
-   Define tags and attributes for the GCM application
-   Define RDF URIs for common or equivalent types, attributes, and
    values
-   Build and manage reports

Any practitioner who must set a global configuration context in their
local application must be a member of the GCM project area that defines
that global configuration.

Read access is granted at the project area level, even for projects with
components. Any user who is part of the access control list (typically
set to project members) has read access to all content in the project
area. At this time, you cannot restrict read access by component or by
configuration. In the RM application, you can restrict write actions for
artifact types defined by each component. All permissions continue to be
set in the project area administration.

At this time, permissions also apply across all configurations of a
component or project. Permissions related to configuration management
actions (for example, taking a baseline or delivering a change set) must
be granted at the project area level, not a team level. In the RM
project, you can control who can create and deliver change sets. To
deliver change sets across streams, a user must have permission to
deliver other users' change sets as well as their own. \#LinkValidity
----++++! Enable link validity As part of managing change, enable link
validity in your project or component properties and define how you want
to use it (for example, who should set the link to valid and at what
point). Use the comment capability to convey more information about the
reason a link became invalid.

ClmCurlUtility.sh is a script that allows you to access POST, GET, PUT,
DELETE operations on a CLM server from a command line. It handles logins
and cookie management (for X-Jazz-CSRF-Prevent).

The script uses "Curl" on Cygwin (Windows) or Linux systems.

It allows you to automatically iterate to create N users or projects,
which is handy for testing.

This script uses the same command line parameters as RqmUrlUtility. It
does add an -iterations N option to run the same invocation N times. It
adds special GET (stdout) and POST (stdin + stdout) options.

Unlike RqmUrlUtility, it does not require XML input.

# Installing Rational Team Concert from P2 on Eclipse Neon or later DKGRAY Authors: Main.LarrySmith [installing-rational-team-concert-from-p2-on-eclipse-neon-or-later-dkgray-authors-main.larrysmith]

Build basis: Rational Team Concert 6.0 and later, Eclipse 4.6 and later.
ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

When installing the Rational Team Concert using the process of
downloading Eclipse then installing from the RTC P2 repository, a
special process must be followed to first install the Eclipse GEF
component.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Rational Team Concert installation

With Collaborative Lifecycle Manager the Rational Team Concert (RTC)
client can be installed in Eclipse either by using Installation manager,
or by adding features from an Eclipse P2 repository file into an
existing or new Eclipse installation. When the installed version is
Eclipse 4.6 (Neon), 4.7 (Oxygen), or later, the Eclipse GEF component
must be installed before installing RTC.

### Installing RTC into Eclipse 4.6 and later from P2

The steps to install are:

1\) Download Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) or 4.7 (Oxygen). Install Eclipse.

2\) Download the RTC P2 repository from the jazz.net or other site.

3\) Start Eclipse. Use the Install New Software action from the menu and
select the Eclipse update site such as
download.eclipse.org/releases/neon/ or
download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen/.

4\) Select Eclipse GEF and install it. Restart Eclipse. Now it is
possible to install from the RTC P2 repository update site.

5\) Select Install New Software, Install From Archive, and select the P2
repository. Restart Eclipse.

Rational Team Concert should be available in the Eclipse client. To
verify, open the Work Items perspective.

This article discusses how to configure recent Eclipse (e.g. Eclipse 4.4
Neon) versions to remove an issue where the project area is shown with
all sections "Unconfigured".

## VM Argument to Enable Access to External Schema

The issue is caused by a new Java VM parameter that requires opt-in to
allow the client to access external schema, which is required to
configure the project area. When opening a project area editor in
Eclipse, all sections are shown as "Unconfigured".

In addition, an error in the process configuration.xml flags to the
access to external schema. The failing "Schema Error" line in the
process.xml is like:

The fix for this is to add a VM argument to the eclipse.ini file. In
Windows this file is the Eclipse installation directory; in Mac you must
select eclipse.app and use the menu item "Show Package Contents" then
update the /Content/MacOS/eclipse.ini file.

The change is to add a line at the end:

-Djavax.xml.accessExternalSchema=all

A final eclipse.ini file may look like this:

-startup
../../../plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.3.0.v20140415-2008.jar
--launcher.library

This document outlines the managed beans available in the CLM product
suite.

### CLM Managed Beans

As part of improving the CLM serviceability, we added several classes of
managed bean to help give administrators a complete picture of what is
happening in the system. To leverage these managed beans, it is helpful
to understand the basic architecture and the serviceability strategy
that we used to approach the problem.

Below (figure 1) is a high level diagram of the CLM architecture.
Several of the applications share a common development framework, called
the Jazz Application Foundation SDK. The managed beans that have been
built have been built as part of this SDK so all applications that are
built on top of it get these managed beans by default. For parts of the
CLM suite that are not built on this framework, they have to build their
managed beans from scratch.

figure 1. The High Level CLM Architecture Overview

As the diagram shows, several applications (tan boxes) share a common
framework and these applications have managed beans. JTS, RTC, RQM,
RDNG, RDM, and GC all have managed beans.

Now that you understand what applications have managed beans, consider
the **Service Invocation Architecture** described in figure 2 and the
recommended attributes that should be considered when monitoring the
overall application health.

figure 2. Jazz Service Invocation Architecture

In addition to those attributes that we recommend monitoring, there are
optional attributes that you might want to consider as well, which we
show you in figure 3.

figure 3. Jazz Service Invocation Architecture - Optional Managed Beans

#### Enabling CLM Managed Beans

The managed beans are not enabled by default out of the box. You need to
consider your monitoring strategy and only turn on those managed beans
you will actually consume. These managed beans are enabled through the
advanced properties admin UI. To turn them on, you would locate the
background task in the table below and enable it by setting the enable
property to **true**. It is recommended that you take the default values
because these have been carefully considered and tuned for optimal
efficiency.

`https://<< host:port >>/<< context root >>/admin#action=com.ibm.team.repository.admin.configureAdvanced`

#### Background Tasks

Managed beans are enabled through scheduled background tasks. These
tasks enable one or more managed beans in specific categories.

TOC{title="Page contents"}

This document describes some changes made to the OSLC V2.0 API in RTC
Version 6.0.1. The changes were made to enable specific reports that
required the API to be more compliant with the standard.

There are two OSLC REST API changes made in 6.0.1 that could potentially
break scripts that use the OSLC REST API from prior versions. These
changes are considered improvements over previous releases and were
necessary for standards compliance and to enable cross-project reporting
to work in Report Builder.

-   The first item changes the way enumerations literal URI's are
    specified in responses.
-   The second item changes the response to a JSON request for an
    enumeration so it is a JSON object instead of array of literals.

## The Resource URI of an Enumeration Literal Changes in RTC Version 6.0.1

RTC allows user to specify External Value of enumeration literal. The
literal is configured in the project area administration as follows:

The way this literal is returned in an OSLC response has changed in RTC
Version 6.0.1

### Before RTC Version 6.0.1: Enumeration without an External Value

**Before RTC Version 6.0.1**, consider an enumeration literal without an
external value:

Before RTC Version 6.0.1, if user doesnt specify an External Value and
then does an OSLC GET on the enumeration literal resource, the literal
is referenced with the internal value:

For example, a GET request:

would return a response:

Low priority.literal.1

This does not change in RTC Version 6.0.1 because there is no external
value.

### Before RTC Version 6.0.1: Enumeration with an External Value

**Before RTC Version 6.0.1**, consider an enumeration literal with an
external value:

Before RTC Version 6.0.1, if user does specify an external value and
then does an OSLC GET on the enumeration literal resource, the literal
is referenced with the external value:

Notice how the literal value is used in the reference URI.

For example, a GET request:

would return a response:

Low priority.literal.1

When the external value changes, these URI's will note be valid anymore.

## After RTC Version 6.0.1 the URI is Stable

One drawback of the initial implementation is that the enumeration
literal resource URI is not stable. The URI can change if the user
changes the enumeration value of the enumeration literal. Since the
enumeration literal URI is embedded in every work item and enumeration
resources referenced, the links and data becomes invalid when the
enumeration value changes.

In 6.0.1 release, the URI is made more stable by always using the
internal literal value in the reference and adding an *owl:sameAs*
triple in the resource to map the value properly. The value of
owl:sameAs triple is the external URI of the enumeration literal.

For more information see Best Practice: Use URIs to Represent Enumerated
Values.

### After RTC Version 6.0.1: Enumeration with External Value

In RTC Version 6.0.1 and later, consider if user does specify external
value for the literal:

Now when an OSLC GET is requested for the enumeration literal resource,
the literal is referenced with the internal value and an *owl:sameAs*
element is added:

...

...

Notice how the literal value is not used in the reference URI and is
mapped by the *owl:sameAs* element. Now the administrator is free to
change the literal value without invalidating the links. Because the
*owl:sameAs* resolves the links correctly, the pre-6.0.1 user scenarios
is still supported as the literal resource can be accessed using either
URI.

For example, a GET request:

would return a response:

Low priority.literal.1

The new URI format is more stable for some configurations.

## Enumeration Requests Return a JSON Object instead of an Array

Before RTC Version 6.0.1, when user gets an application/json
representation of an enumeration resource, the returned resource was
returned as a JSON array of enumeration literals. However, array
returned for the enumeration resource does not contain any information
about the enumeration itself. It only lists the enumeration literals. In
6.0.1, a JSON object is returned instead, and this includes information
about enumeration itself in the resource representation.

### Before RTC Version 6.0.1: Enumeration JSON Response

For example, **before RTC Version 6.0.1**, a GET request:

would return an array as a response.

\[ { "rdf:type":\[ {
"rdf:resource":"[http:\\\\jazz.net\\xmlns\\prod\\jazz\\rtc\\cm\\1.0\\Literal](http:\/\/jazz.net\/xmlns\/prod\/jazz\/rtc\/cm\/1.0\/Literal)"

"dcterms:identifier":"priority.literal.1" },

"dcterms:identifier":"priority.literal.2" } \]

The array only provides information about the literals and does not
contain any information about the enumeration.

### After RTC Version 6.0.1: Enumeration JSON Response

**After RTC Version 6.0.1**, the resource is returned as a a JSON
object. For example, in RTC Version 6.0.1, a GET request:

now returns a JSON object as a response:

Designer. It's a working example and source code for integrating with
ELM and includes common operations such as authenticating with ELM using
OAuth. It works with non-configuration management-enabled CLM systems
(aka "opt-out" DNG and RQM).

### Global Configuration Management

GCM is a provider of global configurations as defined by the OSLC
Configuration Management draft specification; EWM SCM, Doors Next, and
ETM are providers of local configurations. These applications implement
the appropriate APIs from that specification.

Drafts of the OSLC Configuration Management Specification can be found
on the [OSLC Specifications
page](https://open-services.net/specifications/).

## DOORS Next Generation

Global Configuration Management REST API Documentation for the Global
Configuration Management REST API can be found at
<https://%5Bserver%5D>:\[port\]/gc/doc/scenarios. You must have the GC
application installed to access this link. This API is a collection of
REST services that client applications use to create and update
components, create new streams, create baselines, update a stream to
match a baseline, and other operations. REST client applications can use
the API to programmatically perform many of the operations that are
usually done through the GCM web user interface. See [RM Enhancement

the [OSLC workshop](https://jazz.net/library/article/635). This will
help them better understand the various different options for extending
and enhancing the Jazz solution, and will provide valuable insight into
how to implement the needed customizations.

In the CLM 6.0.1 release, the number of users added explicitly as
members of a project area can degrade performance. This effect is most
noticeable in Rational Quality Manager and Rational Team Concert, and
can have an impact as the number of project area members grows beyond
1000. In this article, I'll discuss the impact that project area
membership has on performance, and describe some options that you have
to reduce this impact. I'll also highlight performance improvements
available starting in the 6.0.1 ifix stream, and additional improvements
available in the 6.0.4 release.

## Overview

In Jazz releases prior to 6.0.1 ifix9, performance is impacted by
project and team area membership. The following factors impact
performance:

-   The number of users added as members to a project area
-   The number of users added as members to a team area
-   The number of team areas. This is a factor because the code that
    checks whether a user has permission to execute an operation
    iterates through the team areas. The combination of a large number
    of team areas with large membership magnifies the performance
    impact.
-   The number of roles

Under light load, the main symptom of degradation is an increase in
response times. Operations that take less than a second in a project
area with few members can take several seconds or more as the
mermbership increases past 1000 users. Under heavier load, you can see
much higher CPU utilization, with the server potentially reaching 100
CPU at low levels of concurrency. If the system is at 100 CPU usage for
sustained periods, the response times degrade significantly; the system
is effectively overloaded.

# CLM Sizing Strategy [clm-sizing-strategy]

## Introduction

Whether new users or seasoned experts, customers using IBM Jazz products
all want the same thing: They want to use the Jazz products without
worrying that their deployment implementation will slow them down, that
it will keep up with them as they add users and grow. A frequent
question we hear, whether its from a new administrator setting up
Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM) for the first time, or an
experienced administrator tuning their Systems and Software Engineering
(SSE) toolset, is How many users will my environment support?

Back when Rational Team Concert (RTC) was in its infancy we built a
comprehensive performance test environment based on what we thought was
a representative workload. It was in fact based upon the workload the
RTC and Jazz teams itself used to develop the product. We published what
we learned in our first [Sizing
Guide](https://jazz.net/library/content/articles/rtc/2.0/enterprise-configuration/sizing-guide/index.html).
Later sizing guides include: [Collaborative Lifecycle Management 2011
Sizing Guide](https://jazz.net/library/article/641) and [Collaborative
Lifecycle Management 2012 Sizing Report (Standard Topology
E1)](https://jazz.net/library/article/814). As features were added and
the release grew, we started to hear about what folks were doing in the
field. The Jazz products, RTC especially, are so flexible that customers
were using them with wonderfully different workloads than we had
anticipated.

Consequently, we stepped back from proclaiming a one-size fits all
approach, and moved to presenting case studies and specific test reports
about the user workload simulations and the loads we tested. We have
published these reports on the jazz.net Deployment wiki at [Performance
datasheets](PerformanceDatasheetsAndSizingGuidelines). We have tried to
make a distinction between performance reports and sizing guides.
Performance reports document a specific test with defined hardware,
datashape and workload, whereas sizing guides suggest patterns or
categories of hardware, datashape and workload. Sizing reports are not
specific and general descriptions of topologies and estimations of
workloads they may support.

Throughout the many 4.0.x release cycles, we were still asked How many
users will my environment support? Our reluctance to answer this
apparently straightforward question frustrated customers new and old.
Everyone thinks that as the Jazz experts we should know how to size our
products. Finally, after some analysis and messing up countless
whiteboards, we would like to present some sizing strategies and advice
for the front-end applications in the Jazz platform: Rational Team
Concert (RTC), Rational Requirements Composer (RRC)/Rational DOORS Next
Generation (DNG) and Rational Quality Manager (RQM). These
recommendations are based upon our product testing and analysis of
customer deployments.

## Standard disclaimer

A sizing estimate is an approximation of the hardware or software
resources required to support an application set that is either
currently implemented or new. The level of effort and scope of sizing
degree of variability can range from small to very significant. Sizing
does not constitute a performance guarantee. Customer results may vary,
and IBM assumes no liability for actual results that differ from any
estimates provided by IBM.

## Where does this data come from?

The data in this sizing advice document comes from tests executed by the
Rational Performance Engineering team and hardware and sizing models
generated by IBM Global Techline, an internal pre-sales technical
support organization. Further refinements of user patterns are derived
from our analysis of many customer deployments. Specific references to
the relevant data and test reports are cited below.

## Basic principles

-   **The jazz products are wonderfully flexible.** Whether you are new
    to Agile or a continuous integration junkie, the Jazz products will
    make planning, tracking, collaborating and delivering your project
    easier than ever before. They can be deployed in variety of
    configurations and they can be used in any number of ways. They can
    be used by large teams and small teams, co-located teams or widely
    distributed teams.
-   **What works for one customer might not work for another.** Each
    organization has its own processes, rules, templates and habits.
    Each organization has valuable employees with varied skills and
    experiences. The workflow and datashape in use at one company will
    probably not meet the needs and demands of any other company. Each
    company has rules about how systems and hardware are configured and
    maintained, and one organizations compliance may not be appropriate
    for anothers. Every organization has unique network characteristics,
    user authentication, VPNs and customized desktop configurations.
    Given all these and possibly other innate differences, the identical
    hardware deployed at one customer cannot be guaranteed to behave
    similarly to the exact deployment at another customer.
-   **It is normal for a customers workload to change during a project
    lifecycle.** As end-users discover their optimal ways to work with
    the flexible Jazz tools, its not uncommon that the way they interact
    with the Jazz products changes over time. It isnt just that more
    requirements are created at the beginning of a project, or that more
    defects are sometimes logged towards the end, its that as teams
    practice Agile and get used to iterative development, they work more
    collaboratively and leverage the strengths of the Jazz platform. For
    example, in some organizations, the number of work items in plans
    decrease, however work items increase their parent-child
    relationships.

## Recommended topologies

We have outlined [recommended deployment topologies for the CLM and SSE
products](StandardTopologiesOverview) on the jazz.net Deployment wiki.
Customers implementing the Rational solution for Collaborative Lifecycle
Management (CLM) or the Rational solution for Systems and Software
Engineering (SSE) often ask how they should deploy the tools so that
they perform well, run robustly, and can evolve without restriction. To
simplify the wide range of choices, the Standard Topologies article
series outline several standard topologies which are the expected and
most frequently chosen deployment patterns.

## Minimum requirements and practical limitations

We suggest an ideal minimum of 4 logical processors and 8 GB RAM on a
64-bit machine. The absolute minimum is 4 GB of RAM on a 64-bit machine,
but for an enterprise deployment we prefer to suggest the ideal minimum.
Also see [System Requirements for Collaborative Lifecycle Management
4.0.5 and 4.0.6](CLMSystemRequirements405406) and [System Requirements
for Systems and Software Engineering 4.0.5 and
4.0.6](SSESystemRequirements405).

You will notice that the [published test
reports](PerformanceDatasheetsAndSizingGuidelines) utilize hardware
(cores and RAM) which are sized generously. A well designed deployment
will be able to handle peak loads and unexpected usage patterns. We
customarily size environments so that they may be able to accommodate
bursts of up to double the amount of expected normal load. However, we
do not recommending presuming an environment can handle such extreme
loads for more than 4 of their standard operational time.

## A deployments performance can be influenced by many things

The performance and behavior of a CLM or SSE deployment can be
influenced by many factors or dimensions. These dimensions fall into two
categories: application and product related (functional dimensions) and
environment or topology related (non-functional dimensions). CLM and
SSEs flexibility and performance can be undermined by unintentional
functional and non-functional design choices.

It is easy to design an ideal topology which presumes zero-second
latency, unlimited bandwidth and ever-increasing storage capacity, but
such capabilities are impossible in real deployments where there are
known and possibly unexpected constraints and limits. It is important to
be mindful of the gamut of possible constraints for the various
dimensions of a CLM and SSE environment.

This table collects some of the factors which may influence performance.
This table is by no means comprehensive. There may be other factors not
listed here. A factor listed here may have different effect in different
environments.

Dimension Factors unique to every customer deployment which may
influence performance

    that show graphs and BIRT reports)
-   Complex plan views (e.g.: plans which also show Gantt charts)

    in size than anticipated
-   User population is not geographically distributed (e.g.: all users
    commonly use the environment at set schedules, or are expected to
    login near coincidentally at the start of a workday)

Organizational Maturity

-   More mature teams (greater degree of Agile experience or even a
    highly developed waterfall process) tend to use a system more
    intensively

## Given assumptions and caveats

-   All hardware and operating systems are 64-bit.
-   Representative product workloads (examples of how teams actually use
    the tools and what sort of load and transactions may occur) are
    described within the Rational Performance Engineering datasheets
    accessible [here](PerformanceDatasheetsAndSizingGuidelines).
-   For these examples, each application (Rational Team Concert,
    Rational Requirements Composer/Rational DOORS Next Generation, and
    Rational Quality Manager) are hosted on a dedicated server and
    connected to a separate Jazz Team Server (JTS). This document does
    not address how the Jazz Team Server (JTS) scales. JTS scaling
    information can be found
    [here](PerformanceImpactOfSharingAJazzTeamServer).
-   Sizing estimates are provided for an approximate range of concurrent
    or active users. Decreasing the range of estimated concurrent users
    does not equate to a corresponding decrease in estimated resources.
    In other words, if an estimate provides a range of 300 to 500
    concurrent users, it cannot be assumed that reducing by half the
    number of cores and RAM will meet the needs of half the amount of
    estimated users. In fact, we would recommend the same hardware
    configuration whether estimating for 150 to 250 users or 300 to 500
    concurrent users.
-   Similarly, increasing the range of estimated concurrent users does
    not equate to a corresponding increase in estimated resources. In
    other words, if an estimate provides a range of 300 to 500
    concurrent users, it cannot be assumed that doubling the amount of
    cores and RAM will meet the needs of twice as much concurrent users.
-   We cannot estimate the size of database repositories. The size of
    the database is governed by many factors: The organizations
    customized workload, the organizations customized datashape, and the
    work habits of the people in the organization. We suggest estimating
    a generous starting size for your database repositories, but more
    importantly, we suggest monitoring the growth of the repositories.
    Your database will grow based upon how it is used in your
    organization, and understanding your trends and growth patterns is
    the best way to anticipate database sizing needs. It is best to
    consider an enterprise storage solution which supports a high IOPS
    throughput since IO directly impacts performance. In addition mature
    storage solutions have the ability to size volumes as needed and
    optimize storage needs with real-time data deduplication.
-   RAM consumption should never be more than half of the total
    available RAM; Maximum JVM heap size should not exceed half of the
    servers allocated RAM.
-   You may note that the data presented here may be different from data
    previously presented or even data that may be presented in the
    future. This sizing advice does not replace or supersede any other
    advice. Sizing estimates are derived from actual test data and based
    upon assumptions and for the most accurate sizing advice for your
    situation you need to work with IBM to understand your unique
    requirements.
-   This document considers single applications connected to a single
    JTS server. Multiple application servers can be connected to a
    single JTS, and sizing advice for such configurations will be
    considered in a future publication. Considerations and strategies
    for when multiple application servers should be used will be
    discussed in a future publication.

## Registered and concurrent user definitions

When we talk about users, we generally talk about **registered** or
**licensed** users and a subset of **concurrent** or **active** users.
Registered users refer to the number of users who are licensed and
permitted to use a system. A company of 1200 employees may have 800
registered users. Concurrent users are the number of users logged in and
actually using the system at any given time. A company of 1200 employees
may have 800 registered users, but only 200 are logged in and actively
working at any given time. We call these 200 users concurrent and active
regardless of the intensity of how they may be working.

The number of concurrent users can often be estimated from the number of
registered users. In an organization located on one continent or
spanning just a few time zones, the number of concurrent users can be
estimated to be between 20 and 25 of the total number of registered
users. In an organization which spans the globe where registered users
work in many different time zones, the number of concurrent users can be
estimated to be between 10 and 15 of the total number of registered
users.

For now we discuss server load in terms of users. This can be
potentially misleading as different organizations users will work
differently. We plan to add more precise transaction-rate and
workload-rate data to our reports and sizing estimates, but for now, we
specify server load in terms of users.

## Rational Team Concert (RTC): Examples of different RTC usage patterns

Of all the Jazz products, Rational Team Concert (RTC) permits the widest
variety of end-user and automated workflows. When estimating a RTC
workload it is important to consider what percentage of the anticipated
usage will come from work item users, SCM users and build agents or any
combination of the three. Description of representative RTC workload we
use in our sizing estimates can be found
[here](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/RationalTeamConcert406PerformanceReport#Test_cases_and_workload_characte).

Rational Team Concert (RTC) has three major workload types which can be
used concurrently:

-   Work item
-   Software configuration management (SCM)
-   Build agent

Our representative workloads combine these major workload types:

## What is a sizing estimate for anyway? What are the next steps?

A sizing estimate attempts to forecast the number of users which a
prescribed hardware configuration may comfortably support with a maximum
response time at a defined interaction rate and a typical datashape. A
sizing document is often created before a product is deployed in order
to estimate the anticipated hardware needs for a deployment. Sometimes
the sizing documents most immediate goal is to specify hardware for
allocation or procurement. Very often the sizing document specifies a
maximum or largest anticipated target number of users simply so that the
corresponding hardware allocation will not be exceeded and the
anticipated hardware is requested only once.

Every CLM sizing document is an estimate: The CLM products are flexible
and can be deployed to meet customers needs; customer hardware and
deployment environments are unique for each customer; customer workload
and habits will be unique and can be expected to vary across the
products deployment lifetime.

A sizing estimate represents the best-guess assessment at a given point
in time. As an environment is uses and grows, it is natural that
assumptions made to support the sizing estimate may change. After
deploying the environment we strongly recommend [monitoring the
environment](DeploymentMonitoring) and re-evaluating the assumptions and
conclusions made during the planning phase as part of a deployments
maintenance strategy. It is typical that an environment will grow and
mature differently than the sizing estimate may anticipate. A standard
maintenance and monitoring plan should include revisiting the sizing
estimate and appropriately adjusting and tuning your deployment at key
milestones, if not at a yearly minimum.

## Introduction

Whether new users or seasoned experts, customers using IBM Jazz products
all want the same thing: They want to use the Jazz products without
worrying that their deployment implementation will slow them down, and
that it will keep up with them as they add users and grow. A frequent
question we hear, whether its from a new administrator setting up
Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM) for the first time, or an
experienced administrator keeping an eye on an existing deployment , is
How many users will my environment support? In this article, we'll
answer that question by drawing on the tests executed by the Rational
Performance Engineering team, the hardware and sizing models generated
by IBM Global Techline (an internal pre-sales support organization), as
well as our analysis of many customer deployments.

Estimating the number of users that can be supported by a given set of
hardware is hard to do precisely, since so much depends on what exactly
the users are doing. So, we'll provide estimates for what we consider
typical workloads running against typical datasets. We'll also provide
information on what most influences the performance of a deployment, so
you can evaluate whether these typical workloads can be good predictors
for your own deployments.

### Standard disclaimer

The information contained in this article is derived in part from data
collected from tests performed in IBM test labs, under controlled
conditions. Customer results may vary greatly. Sizing does not
constitute a performance guarantee. IBM assumes no liability for actual
results that differ from any estimates provided by IBM.

## Factors that influence performance

Later in this document, we provide estimates for the number of users
that typical deployments of the CLM products can support. But to put
those estimates into context, we need to discuss the factors that most
influence performance, so you can understand whether the estimates will
apply to your specific environments. Here are the things we consider
when designing our own performance tests:

-   Deployment topology. How many servers will be deployed, and what are
    the specifications of the servers (memory, number of CPUs, disk I/O
    speed)?
-   Data. How big is the deployment (how many artifacts and of what
    kind)? At what rate is the deployment growing, as people create more
    artifacts?
-   Application usage. How many people are actively using the system at
    any one time? What are those people doing? Has the application been
    customized or extended?

As a starting point, we assume a server will have at least 16G of total
RAM (with 8G dedicated to Java) and 8 logical processors. You may need
more memory or more processors, however, depending on your workload (and
in some cases, you may be able able to use less). Additionally,
deployments involving more than 50 active users should be deployed
across multiple servers, as described in our [recommended deployment
topologies for the CLM and SSE
products](RecommendedALMDeploymentTopologies6) on the jazz.net
Deployment wiki.

### Impact of deployment topology

As a general rule, the number of active users that can be supported by a
deployment is most strongly influenced by the number of available
processors. Our own performance tests show that the throughput which a
deployment can handle (in terms of requests per second) increases
linearly as the number of processors increases (up to 24 processors,
anyway). As the number of active users increases, the number of requests
sent to the server over a given interval increases. Since these requests
are handled in parallel inside the application server, you need more
CPUs available to handle more parallel work. As the CPU utilization on a
server nears 100, it takes longer to process the transactions, which
means that response times degrade.

The reliability of a CLM deployment is most strongly influenced by the
available RAM. Without enough memory, the CLM applications can hang or
crash. You'll need to allocate enough RAM to satisfy the primary
consumers of memory on a CLM server, which are:

-   The memory heap for the Java run-time environment that is running
    the CLM application
-   Native memory used by the Java run-time (especially critical for
    network operations involving file transfers)
-   Memory used by the operating system.

The amount of RAM available can also influence performance, in two
primary ways:

-   If the JVM heap is not large enough, or is not tuned correctly,
    system performance can be degraded by garbage collection.
-   If there is too much demand for memory, the operating system's file
    cache may shrink and this can impact the caching of index data used
    by CLM applications. This is especially true for DOORS Next
    Generation and the Lifecycle Query Engine.

These factors are behind our [recommended deployment topologies for the
CLM and SSE products](RecommendedALMDeploymentTopologies6) on the
jazz.net Deployment wiki. We recommend running each application on its
own server, with a separate JTS server. We would additionally recommend
no fewer than 8 logical processors per server and 16G of RAM (with 8G
dedicated to the JVM heap). Deploying multiple systems of this class
allows the CLM workload to be spread out across more processors and
memory, and allows each application to run without interference from
other co-located applications.

There are exceptions to 8 processor/16G recommendations, and these will
be discussed later. You may need as much as 256G of RAM for large DOORS
Next Generation or Lifecycle Query Engine deployments, for example. Your
database servers will usually benefit from additional RAM and
processors, especially as your deployment grows. Also, if you deploy
fewer servers (e.g. combining Rational Team Concert, Rational Quality
Manager, and Jazz Team Server on one system), those servers will need to
be larger. A 4 processor/8G server will struggle with 50 active users,
especially when all of the CLM applications are running on one server.
Keep this in mind if you are considering using a [departmental
topology](AlternativeALMDeploymentTopologies6). You may be able to use
systems with 4 processors/8G RAM for RTC workloads that only involve
workitems.

You will notice that the [published test
reports](PerformanceDatasheetsAndSizingGuidelines) utilize hardware
(cores and RAM) which are sized generously. A well designed deployment
will be able to handle peak loads and unexpected usage patterns. We
customarily size environments so that they may be able to accommodate
bursts of up to double the amount of expected normal load. However, we
do not recommending presuming an environment can handle such extreme
loads for more than 5 of their standard operational time.

### Impact of data (repository size)

The size of your repository can impact performance, and can influence
the hardware requirements needed to deliver good performance. When we
talk about repository size, we really mean two distinctly different
things:

-   The number of artifacts of each particular type (e.g. how many work
    items, how many test cases, how many requirements...). We think of
    this as the **repository size**.
-   The structure of those artifacts and the relationships between them
    (e.g. work items can be associated with a development plan, test
    cases can be associated with a test plan, requirements can be added
    to a module, artifacts can reference each other via links...). We
    think of this as the **repository shape**.

We recommend that you develop a model of how your users will interact
with the system, so that you can have a rough idea of how the size of
the deployment will evolve over time. When we do this for our own
performance tests, we start by thinking about the user population, and
we identify the primary roles which individuals take on as they do their
jobs. We then define the operations which each role is likely to
perform, and we estimate the frequency at which each operation will
occur. From this you can then estimate how many artifacts are likely to
be created over time.

For example, you may have a total user base of 1000 people. If half of
those people are using Rational Team Concert, and if on average the RTC
users create 5 work items per day, then the total number of workitems
created per day would be 1000 x .5 x 5 = 2500 work items per day. Over
the course of a year (assuming a 5 day work week and 50 working weeks
per year), that would work out to 625,000 work items per year. You could
further refine this model by thinking about the project structure and
how these 625,000 work items would be distributed across RTC project
areas. You could think about how long your development iterations are,
and then estimate how many work items are managed in a typical iteration
to estimate how big your development plans are likely to be, and how
much data is likely to surface in dashboard queries.

The size and shape of your repository has an influence on several areas:

-   The full-text index (used for artifact searching) grows as artifacts
    are added.
-   Several components use a triple-store database (based on Jena
    technology), and this will grow as artifacts are created. The
    components which are most impacted by the size of the triple-store
    are:
    -   DOORS Next Generation
    -   The Lifecycle query engine
    -   In CLM 6.x and later, the backlink indexing service that runs on
        the Jazz Team Server (JTS)
-   The database tables which store CLM data grow as the number of
    artifacts grows. SQL queries may then return increasing amounts of
    data over time. This can be computationally expensive (such as
    applying complex joins) as well as memory-intensive (due to storing
    the query results in memory)
-   Native Java memory (specifically, direct memory buffers), used by
    the Web application servers to send information over the network to
    browsers (or RTC Eclipse clients). The source code management
    features in RTC can be particularly impacted by the size of source
    files, the number of files in a workspace, and frequency at which
    workspaces are refreshed (such as through builds).
-   Java heap memory, since larger repositories result in more data
    being transferred from server to client, which then requires
    additional memory in the CLM application servers. As the memory
    demands on the Java heap grow, performance can degrade if garbage
    collection gets triggered more frequently. There can also be high
    transient demands on memory (e.g. when running reports which return
    large result sets).

Both the full-text index and the triple-store use the operating system's
file system cache to help optimize queries. The file system cache will
keep the indices in memory if there is enough free RAM, but if other
applications need RAM, the operating system will shrink the file system
cache. You'll get the best performance out of a server with large
indices if you have enough RAM to keep most of the indices in memory. As
a rule of thumb, you can look at the size of the indices on disk, and
estimate the total amount of RAM required by looking at the sum of: JVM
max heap size + disk size of indices...and then add an additional 4G for
the overhead of operating system processes.

Some CLM applications (like the Lifecycle Query Engine) use
memory-mapped I/O for the triple-store, instead of the file cache. But
the dynamic is similar: you need enough RAM to keep the indices in
memory in order to maintain performance.

Database servers also benefit from additional RAM as repositories grow.
Most databases use memory to cache information (like DB2's buffer
pools), so when you have more RAM, you have the ability to cache more
data (which can then speed up SQL queries). Since a single database
server is usually shared between the CLM application servers, the memory
demands on the database server are a functional of the combined load
across all CLM application servers. If your CLM deployment will host
millions of artifacts, across multiple applications like RTC, RQM, and
DNG - then you should deploy database servers with 32G or more of
memory.

Tuning the JVM can be complex, but we have a few recommendations:

-   Use a gencon (generational collector) garbage collection strategy
-   Set the max and the minimum heap values to the same value, and use a
    heap of no less than 4G (and no more than 24G). By keeping the max
    and min heaps at the same value, you reduce the work which the JVM
    would otherwise do to shrink the heap.
-   Size the nursery to be at least 25 of the max heap (although 33 is
    better). With a gencon garbage collection strategy, the nursery is a
    place for fast access to transient memory, like the memory used to
    satisfy an incoming HTTP request. Memory that is needed by the
    application for a long time will get moved out of the nursery into a
    different section of JVM memory - and both the transfer process and
    the ongoing management of the long-term JVM memory is more
    expensive. So, as the number of active users goes up, and the amount
    of memory needed to satisfy their requests goes up (because of
    repository growth), dedicating more memory to the nursery can
    improve response times. See
    <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/1106_bailey/1106_bailey.html>
    for more details on how this works.

The final topic regarding JVM memory and repository size concerns native
memory. An in-depth discussion of how Java uses native memory is
available on developerWorks (see
<http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-linux/>) .
This applies to CLM because the networking support in the application
servers uses direct memory buffers (which are a kind of native memory)
to transfer data. It turns out that direct memory can be reclaimed by
the Java garbage collector, but that reclamation is not very
sophisticated. If a Java program asks for direct memory and there isn't
enough, then the allocation code forces garbage collection to run by
calling System.gc. Unfortunately, this is an inefficent mechanism for
reclaiming Java memory, and so it can result in a long pause (the JVM
stops other processing while doing garbage collection). It can also
result in more frequent garbage collections cycles than would be
required solely by the usage of heap memory.

One way to improve matters is to use a JVM flag to allocate enough
direct memory so that the rate of System.gc calls is reduced (e.g.
setting -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=). To bring this back to our original
topic of data - if your source code repository includes large files, or
if your build schedule involves many parallel builds or a large number
of files, you can end up needing many gigabytes of direct memory, which
in turn means you need more RAM on your RTC server. As much of 3G of
direct memory can be required even in the case of a single user trying
to load a workspace containing a single 1G file.

### Impact of application usage

Although it is somewhat obvious, the way in which the user population
interacts with a CLM deployment can impact performance. You should have
some understanding of what people are going to be doing when considering
how to size your servers. The main things to consider are:

-   How many total users do you expect? How many users are likely to use
    the different CLM products?
-   At any given point, how many users will be actively using the
    system?
-   What will the users be doing?

As the number of active users go up, the CPU and memory resources needed
to handle the traffic from those users goes up. Because our sizing
estimates are focused on active users, it is worth exploring what we
mean by that in more detail.

#### Registered vs active users

When we talk about users, we generally talk about registered or licensed
users and a subset of concurrent or active users. Registered users refer
to the number of users who are licensed and permitted to use a system.
For example, a company of 1200 employees may have 800 registered users
or even fewer, given that not everyone will need to use the CLM tools.
Active (or concurrent) users are the number of users logged in and
actually using the system at any given time. A company of 1200 employees
may have 800 registered users, but only 200 are logged in and actively
working at any given time. We call these 200 users concurrent and active
regardless of the intensity of how they may be working.

The number of concurrent users can often be estimated from the number of
registered users. In an organization located on one continent or
spanning just a few time zones, the number of concurrent users can be
estimated to be between 20 and 25 of the total number of registered
users. In an organization which spans the globe where registered users
work in many different time zones, the number of concurrent users can be
estimated to be between 10 and 15 of the total number of registered
users.

The next thing to consider is how busy the active users really are. In
our performance testing, we typically assume that each simulated user
performs an operation once per minute on average. That may seem like a
low rate, but it is an average that tries to account for the times when
someone is doing other things (like taking a phone call, attending a
meeting, or going to lunch). The activity of any single user is going to
vary greatly, so what we try to do is to model the activity of the
entire user population. If you assume that there will always be 200
active users, and each active user does something once per minute (60
operations per hour), then that works out to a load on the server of 3
operations per second. Since each operation (like creating a workitem)
consists of several HTTP requests, that can be as much as 30 HTTP
transactions per second sent to the server for that set of 200 active
users.

Trying to model your usage realistically is perhaps the most important
step you can take to sizing your servers properly. It is easy to
overestimate the number of active users and how busy they are. Since
you'll need more powerful hardware to support heavier load, you want to
be sure that your usage estimates are not too conservative (while still
allowing for bursts of activity).

#### Making predictions from user load

There are some simplifying assumptions that you can make to make sizing
a bit easier. These are reasonable as first approximations which hold in
most cases, although of course there are always exceptions.

The first assumption is that if you use the enterprise deployment
topologies and place each application on its own server, then you don't
need to worry about interactions between the applications. In other
words, you can size your RTC server based on your RTC workload, and you
can size your RQM server based on your RQM workload, and the total user
load across the deployment is additive. You can have 250 active RTC
users and 250 active RQM users (for a total of 500 users) as long as RTC
and RQM are running on different servers. There is no significant
coupling between workloads due to a shared Jazz Team Server or a shared
database server. The performance bottlenecks usually form in the
application servers.

A corollary is that is you are using a departmental deployment in which
the applications are running on a single server, the workloads are
coupled so that fewer users per application can be supported. If you
could support 400 RTC users on a standalone server, you could only
support 200 RTC users on a server which was hosting both RTC and RQM. In
practice, a departmental topology often involves fewer total processors
and less overall memory, so you need to lower your user expectations
based on that as well. As a rule of thumb, keep the total number of
active users for a departmental topology around 50 (and no more than
100).

The next simplifying assumption is that most operations are similar
enough that you can treat them as identical. This means you can focus
mostly on the number of users and how busy they are, and not worry too
much about what exactly they are doing. There are some exceptions to
this, which will be identified in the sizing sections.

### Miscellaneous assumptions and caveats

That just about wraps up the discussion of the factors that influence
performance. But before we get to the sizing estimations, there are a
few last assumptions and caveats to call out:

-   All hardware and operating systems are 64-bit.
-   Representative product workloads (examples of how teams actually use
    the tools and what sort of load and transactions may occur) are
    described within the Rational Performance Engineering datasheets
    accessible [here](PerformanceDatasheetsAndSizingGuidelines).
-   For these examples, each application (Rational Team Concert,
    Rational Requirements Composer/Rational DOORS Next Generation, and
    Rational Quality Manager) is hosted on a dedicated server and
    connected to a separate Jazz Team Server (JTS). This document does
    not address how the Jazz Team Server (JTS) scales. JTS scaling
    information can be found
    [here](PerformanceImpactOfSharingAJazzTeamServer).
-   Sizing estimates are provided for an approximate range of concurrent
    or active users. Decreasing the range of estimated concurrent users
    does not equate to a corresponding decrease in estimated resources.
    In other words, if an estimate provides a range of 300 to 500
    concurrent users, it cannot be assumed that reducing by half the
    number of cores and RAM will meet the needs of half the amount of
    estimated users. In fact, we would recommend the same hardware
    configuration whether estimating for 150 to 250 users or 300 to 500
    concurrent users.
-   Similarly, increasing the range of estimated concurrent users does
    not equate to a corresponding increase in estimated resources. In
    other words, if an estimate provides a range of 300 to 500
    concurrent users, it cannot be assumed that doubling the amount of
    cores and RAM will meet the needs of twice as much concurrent users.
-   We cannot estimate the size of database repositories. The size of
    the database is governed by many factors: The organizations
    customized workload, the organizations customized datashape, and the
    work habits of the people in the organization. We suggest estimating
    a generous starting size for your database repositories, but more
    importantly, we suggest monitoring the growth of the repositories.
    Your database will grow based upon how it is used in your
    organization, and understanding your trends and growth patterns is
    the best way to anticipate database sizing needs. It is best to
    consider an enterprise storage solution which supports a high IOPS
    throughput since IO directly impacts performance. In addition mature
    storage solutions have the ability to size volumes as needed and
    optimize storage needs with real-time data deduplication.
-   RAM consumption should never be more than half of the total
    available RAM; Maximum JVM heap size should not exceed half of the
    servers allocated RAM.
-   You may note that the data presented here may be different from data
    previously presented or even data that may be presented in the
    future. This sizing advice does not replace or supersede any other
    advice. Sizing estimates are derived from actual test data and based
    upon assumptions and for the most accurate sizing advice for your
    situation you need to work with IBM to understand your unique
    requirements.
-   This document considers single applications connected to a single
    JTS server.
-   The raw guidance is to have less than 500 concurrent users on one
    server. If you have or plan to have more, consider using clustering
    solution.
-   If you use clustered solution, although the clustered solution
    scales linearly, it is recommended to have less but more powerfull
    machines than more but with less resources assigned. The recommended
    number of nodes is to have one node for maximum 500 concurrent users
    plus one additional spare node, in case when any of nodes hangs. It
    means, that for example if you have 700 concurrent users, the best
    starting points is to have 3 nodes.

## Rational Team Concert (RTC): Examples of different RTC usage patterns

Of all the Jazz products, Rational Team Concert (RTC) permits the widest
variety of end-user and automated workflows. When estimating a RTC
workload it is important to consider what percentage of the anticipated
usage will come from work item users, SCM users and build agents or any
combination of the three. Description of representative RTC workload we
use in our sizing estimates can be found
[here](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/RationalTeamConcert406PerformanceReport#Test_cases_and_workload_characte).

Rational Team Concert (RTC) has three major workload types which can be
used concurrently:

-   Work item
-   Software configuration management (SCM)
-   Build agent

Our representative workloads combine these major workload types as
follows:

1.  Work item only workload
2.  Combined work item and SCM workload
3.  Combined workitem, SCM and build agent workload

### Rational Team Concert (RTC): A: Work item only workload

TABLE{ sort="off" columnwidths="200, 200, 400" cellpadding="1"
cellspacing="3"}

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| Given this representative base hardware (configured as hypervisor): | Model | x3550 M4 |
| \^ | Processor | Intel XEON processor E5-2670v2 |
| \^ | Processor speed | 2.5 Ghz |
| And given a virtual machine (VM) of this size: | Logical cores | 12 vCPUs |
| \^ | RAM | 16 GB or more |
| We estimate that this workload will perform comfortably | Approximate range of concurrent work item users: Between 400 and 600 |  |

There are some exceptions which lower the capacity. These include:

-   Use of HTTP filtered value sets to customize workitem fields. This
    customization greatly increases the transaction rate to the server.
    -   Approximate range of concurrent work item users (with customized
        workitems): up to 250
-   Extensive use of work item feeds (e.g. in dashboards or in the RTC
    Eclipse client). Feeds place extra stress on the database server.
    -   Approximate range of concurrent workitem users with heavier feed
        user: between 200 and 300

### Rational Team Concert (RTC): B: Combined work item and SCM workload

TABLE{ sort="off" columnwidths="200, 200, 400" cellpadding="1"
cellspacing="3"}

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| Given this representative base hardware (configured as hypervisor): | Model | x3550 M4 |
| \^ | Processor | Intel XEON processor E5-2670v2 |
| \^ | Processor speed | 2.5 Ghz |
| And given a virtual machine (VM) of this size: | Logical cores | 16 vCPUs |
| \^ | RAM | 32 GB or more |
| We estimate that this workload will perform comfortably | Approximate range of concurrent work item users: Between 200 and 300 |  |
| \^ | Approximate range of concurrent SCM users: Between 100 and 200 |  |

The SCM workload we tested places additional demands on the RTC server,
so additional memory and processors are needed in order to maintain
performance. Concurrent loading of large workspaces in particular can be
expensive. In our testing, we reached 100 CPU utilization on an RTC
server with 4 processors, when initializing the workspaces for 100 test
users (a transfer rate of nearly 3,000,000 files per hour). The response
times of work item operations were temporarily degrading during the
initialization period. So, we recommend that you use additional
processors when combining SCM and work item operations.

### Rational Team Concert (RTC): C: Combined work item, SCM and build agent workload

TABLE{ sort="off" columnwidths="200, 200, 400" cellpadding="1"
cellspacing="3"}

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| Given this representative base hardware (configured as hypervisor): | Model | x3550 M4 |
| \^ | Processor | Intel XEON processor E5-2670v2 |
| \^ | Processor speed | 2.5 Ghz |
| And given a virtual machine (VM) of this size: | Logical cores | 24 vCPUs |
| \^ | RAM | 48 GB or more |
| We estimate that this workload will perform comfortably | Approximate range of concurrent work item users: Between 200 and 300 |  |
| \^ | Approximate range of concurrent SCM users: Between 100 and 200 |  |
| \^ | Approximate range of concurrent build agents (presuming all clients, servers and build agents are at same version level): Between 100 and 200 with the use of a [content caching proxy server between RTC SCM and the build servers](ContentCachingProxyJazzSCM) |  |

## Rational Doors Next Generation (RDNG)

RDNG will perform best on the Linux platform, with DB2 as the database;
there are known performance issues for deployments on Windows (for
virtual systems) and on Oracle. Use fast storage (like SSD drives) if
you expect to have more than 500,000 artifacts. Repository size and user
load are the main factors that impact RNDG performance.

Note that **artifacts should be spread out across multiple project
areas**, with no more than 200,000 artifacts per project area.

### RDNG Sizing guidance for release 6.0.2 and later

RDNG 6.0.2 improved performance by adopting memory-mapped I/O for
accessing index data on the DNG server. The maximum user load therefore
increased in 6.0.2. However, memory-mapped I/O did not reliably improve
performance on virtualized Windows platforms - if you are sizing a
Windows 6.0.2 virtual server, please use the 6.0.1 sizing guidance.

Use the following chart as a rough guide to RDNG server sizing for
Linux/DB2 deployments.

As a general rule, you should expect that a single DNG server can handle
up to 500 concurrent users. Our ongoing scalability tests use up to 1
million artifacts, but we project that 2 million artifacts is the
practical limit. To support 500 users and 2 million artifacts, you will
need to deploy a large server (24 logical procesors, 128G or more of RAM
as well as a fast disk system like an SSD). Also keep in mind that each
project area should have no more than 200,000 artifacts.

If you have fewer artifacts, you can reduce the hardware requirements.
Smaller repositories will need less memory. Smaller user loads will need
fewer processors. However, our minimum recommendation would be a system
no smaller than 16G or RAM and 8 logical processors - but that
configuration should not go past 100 concurrent users and 500,000 total
artifacts.

As the number of artifacts grows beyond 500,000, you will need to add
more RAM and use SSD drives. If you want to minimize the risk of
performance problems with RDNG, use SSD drives from the start. As the
number of artifacts grows past 1 million, consider adding an additional
RDNG server and use that for new projects.

The 6.0.3 release introduced components, which allow for data to be
partitioned within a project area. However, components have limited
impact on scalability. You are still limited to 200,000 artifacts per
project area.

### RDNG Sizing guidance for release 6.0.1 and earlier

Use the following chart as a rough guide to RDNG server sizing for 6.0.1
Linux/DB2 deployments:

As a general rule, you should expect that a single DNG server can handle
up to 400 concurrent users. Our ongoing scalability tests use up to 1
million artifacts, but we project that 2 million artifacts is the
practical limit. To support 300-400 users and 2 million artifacts, you
will need to deploy a large server (24 logical procesors, 128G or more
of RAM as well as a fast disk system like an SSD). If you have fewer
artifacts, you can reduce the hardware requirements. Smaller
repositories will need less memory. Smaller user loads will need fewer
processors. However, our minimum recommendation would be a system no
smaller than 16G or RAM and 8 logical processors - but that
configuration should not go past 100 concurrent users and 500,000 total
artifacts..

As the number of artifacts grows beyond 500,000, you will need to add
more RAM and use SSD drives.

## Appendix A: Additional factors that influence performance

*The material below appeared in the original CLM Sizing strategy
document. I have kept in here for reference, but we have not quantified
the impact of most of these factors through testing, so it is difficult
to act on this information.*

The performance and behavior of a CLM or SSE deployment can be
influenced by many factors or dimensions. These dimensions fall into two
categories: application and product related (functional dimensions) and
environment or topology related (non-functional dimensions). CLM and
SSEs flexibility and performance can be undermined by unintentional
functional and non-functional design choices.

It is easy to design an ideal topology which presumes zero-second
latency, unlimited bandwidth and ever-increasing storage capacity, but
such capabilities are impossible in real deployments where there are
known and possibly unexpected constraints and limits. It is important to
be mindful of the gamut of possible constraints for the various
dimensions of a CLM and SSE environment.

This table collects some of the factors which may degrade performance.
This table is by no means comprehensive. There may be other factors not
listed here. A factor listed here may have different effect in different
environments.

Dimension Factors unique to every customer deployment which may
influence performance

-   Number and type of widgets on a dashboard (e.g.: more than a dozen
    plan widgets; widgets which load charts)
-   Number of tabs on a dashboard (e.g.: dashboards with many widgets
    that show graphs and BIRT reports)
-   Complex plan views (e.g.: plans which also show Gantt charts)

    in size than anticipated
-   User population is not geographically distributed (e.g.: all users
    commonly use the environment at set schedules, or are expected to
    login near coincidentally at the start of a workday)

Organizational Maturity

-   More mature teams (greater degree of Agile experience or even a
    highly developed waterfall process) tend to use a system more
    intensively

## Appendix B: What is a sizing estimate for anyway? What are the next steps?

A sizing estimate attempts to forecast the number of users which a
prescribed hardware configuration may comfortably support with a maximum
response time at a defined interaction rate and a typical datashape. A
sizing document is often created before a product is deployed in order
to estimate the anticipated hardware needs for a deployment. Sometimes
the sizing documents most immediate goal is to specify hardware for
allocation or procurement. Very often the sizing document specifies a
maximum or largest anticipated target number of users simply so that the
corresponding hardware allocation will not be exceeded and the
anticipated hardware is requested only once.

Every CLM sizing document is an estimate: The CLM products are flexible
and can be deployed to meet customers needs; customer hardware and
deployment environments are unique for each customer; customer workload
and habits will be unique and can be expected to vary across the
products deployment lifetime.

A sizing estimate represents the best-guess assessment at a given point
in time. As an environment is uses and grows, it is natural that
assumptions made to support the sizing estimate may change. After
deploying the environment we strongly recommend [monitoring the
environment](DeploymentMonitoring) and re-evaluating the assumptions and
conclusions made during the planning phase as part of a deployments
maintenance strategy. It is typical that an environment will grow and
mature differently than the sizing estimate may anticipate. A standard
maintenance and monitoring plan should include revisiting the sizing
estimate and appropriately adjusting and tuning your deployment at key
milestones, if not at a yearly minimum.

##### Server Operating System Notes

-   *Host Operating Systems are supported on x86-64, POWER, z/OS and
    SPARC hardware. Itanium is not supported.*
-   *CLM and RRDI require 64 bit server OS to host CLM applications.
    32-bit servers are not supported except for small-scale evaluation
    or demonstration purposes.*
-   *The RDNG Converter application will ***not*** run on AIX, IBM i,
    Linux for Power, Solaris or z/OS systems. The server-side
    converter.war, needed to view graphical artifacts, must be deployed
    on a supported Windows, x86 Linux or zLinux platform. If your RDNG
    installation is on a platform not currently supported by the
    converter application, this document describes the delegated
    converter configuration option: [RM Converter Application
    Configuration and Troubleshooting
    Guide](https://jazz.net/library/article/1089).*
-   For the PTFs that need to be installed on enterprise platforms,
    depending on the components you install with IBM Rational
    Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM), see *[Recommended Fixes
    for the Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management applications on
    z/OS and IBM
    i](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27043083)*
-   *For IBMi PTF's are required. For the latest IBM i Group PTFs, go to
    <http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/sline003.nsf/GroupPTFs?OpenView&view=GroupPTFs>.*
-   *IBM z/OS System z 1.10 and 1.9 are only supported if you have paid
    for an IBM Lifecycle Extension for z/OS as mentioned on
    <http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/support/zos_eos_dates.html>.*
-   *Rational Team Concert promotion and deployment support for z/OS
    require the REXX runtime or REXX alternate libraries
    (REXX.\***.SEAGLPA, or REXX.\***.SEAGALT). If you do not have either
    the REXX Library or the REXX Alternate Library installed, you can
    install the REXX Alternate Library to fulfill the REXX Library
    requirement. The REXX Alternate Library is shipped as part of the
    z/OS operating system beginning with release 1.9. The Alternate
    Library is also available as a free download from
    <http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/>.*
-   *"and future OS fixpacks" includes Service Releases (SR's) and
    Updates (RHEL). Fix pack is IBM terminology for a minor release that
    includes fixes (vs. features).*
-   When running any of the following components on z/OS it is highly
    recommended to have a zAAP or run zAAP on zIIP: Rational Team
    Concert Build System toolkit, Rational Build Agent, Rational Team
    Concert ISPF daemon, CLM Server (or any of the capabilities). When
    using DB2 for z/OS as the database it is highly recommended to have
    a zIIP to allow the offloading of the JDBC processing. Follow this
    link for more information about the [System z Application Assist
    Processor
    (zAAP)](http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/hardware/features/zaap/index.html).
    Follow this link for more information about the [zAAP on zIIP
    Capability](http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/hardware/features/ziip/capability.html).
    Follow this link for more information about the [IBM System z
    Integrated Information Processor
    (zIIP)](http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/hardware/features/ziip/index.html).

    Pressures
    Dashboard](https://jazz.net/jazz/web/projects/Jazz20Collaborative20ALM#action=com.ibm.team.dashboard.viewDashboard&tab=_79).
-   The RDNG Document Preview feature is not supported on: IBM i; IBM
    z/OS on System z; RHEL on POWER System or System z; SUSE on POWER
    System or System z; or Solaris operating systems. On those operating
    systems, image generation is not supported, so files will behave the
    same way they did in pre-CLM 5.0.2 releases. For more details, see:
    [Uploaded file
    previews](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/UploadedFilePreviews).
-   The Data Collection Component and Report Builder components of RRDI
    do not support AIX.

### A2. Server Virtualization

For the supported Server Operating Systems above, virtualization is now
supported using any of the IBM SWG supported hypervisors listed in the
[Server Virtualization Policy for IBM
Software](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/virtualization_policy.html).
Notes:

-   Virtualization is supported for the Application layer (Server) Only.
    CLM does not currently support virtualization for the client(s).
-   Please check that the system requirements or release notes of the
    respective hypervisor (edition and version) supports the host
    operating system (edition and version) you plan to use for deploying
    the CLM application(s).

### A3. Memory Requirements

#### CLM Application Server Memory Requirements

-   For CLM 5.0 and later you need a 64-bit operating system and a
    minimum of 4 GB of server memory allocated to the Java virtual
    machine running the Jazz Team Server and all three applications
    (Change and Configuration Management, Quality Management,
    Requirements Management) on one server for small deployments. Larger
    deployments or loads may require significantly more memory.
-   The Java virtual machine max heap memory setting is configured to
    -Xmx4000M for 64-bit platforms and -Xmx1200M for 32-bit platforms
    (for small-scale evaluation or demonstration purposes only). Note
    that the Java virtual machine heap size should only represent a
    fraction of the physical memory (RAM) of the server.
-   For 64-bit deployments where less memory is available, it is
    possible - although strongly discouraged - to configure the Java
    virtual machine memory size to a lower setting (e.g. -Xmx1200M to
    match the 32-bit setup) - be aware that it may results in memory
    outages and/or performance degradation. For the Tomcat installation,
    the server.startup script file to edit is located under
    JazzInstallDir/server/, and controlled by the line: set
    JAVA_OPTS=JAVA_OPTS -Xmx4000M. For a WebSphere Application Server
    installation, please consult the WebSphere Administrative Console,
    and modify Servers\>Application Servers\>server1\>Java and Process
    Management\>Process Definition\>Java Virtual Machine\>Maximum Heap
    Size.
-   Memory requirements can be reduced by running a subset of
    applications such as just CCM to support RTC-only functionality.
    Additionally if applications and/or the Jazz Team Server are running
    on different machines, memory requirements for specific machines may
    be reduced.

#### RRDI Server Memory Requirements

-   8 GB RAM. More memory generally improves performance; required
    memory depends on the number of concurrent users, amount of data
    being requested, and the size of the database. Optimum swap space is
    double the physical memory.

### A4. Network Infrastructure

-   IPv6
-   IPv4

### A5. Application Servers The following application servers can be used to host CLM applications:

##### Database Support Notes

-   Database support is 64-bit only to align with 64-bit server
    platforms. For RRDI the 32-bit database client library is required
    (even though the database server is 64-bit).
-   Bundling: WAS 8.5.5 and DB2 10.5 bundles are only available on
    Passport Advantage and in the CLM Media (not on Jazz.net). Customers
    upgrading from CLM 4.0.x are entitled to continue using DB2 10.1 as
    long as CLM supports that version.
-   The DB2 HADR functionality is included and can be used with the
    Limited Use Workgroup and Enterprise Server Editions. However, there
    must be entitlement coverage for the secondary/standby server. There
    is a 1:1 entitlement ratio for DB2 with the entitlement purchased by
    the customer of the bundling product. For eg. 500 PVUs of Portal
    entitles customer to use a maximum of 500 PVUs of DB2 in support of
    Portal. The entitlement requirement for the standby server depends
    on the standby configuration used, and is defined in the DB2
    license. ie. Hot standby requires equivalent entitlement as the
    Primary. Warm standby requires 100 PVUs/25 AUs, regardless of
    Primary. Cold standby server is free. Definition of hot/warm/cold
    standby configurations is also in the DB2 license.
-   Oracle is not supported for System z or IBM i.
-   SQL Server is supported on Windows Server only.
-   JTS Setup for Microsoft SQL Server does not support Integrated
    Authentication. You will be unable to install CLM in your
    environment. Ensure that server security is in mixed mode. To
    validate this, check server security -- it should be set to SQL
    Server and Windows Authentication Mode.
-   Database Pressures - these items are NOT currently in plan but are
    under consideration for future quarterly releases:

## C. Additional RTC Clients and Optional Tools

### C1.RTC Clients N-1 Compatibility

-   For upgrades, after upgrading the Server, teams may choose to
    gradually upgrade the clients. CLM supports N-1 (keeping the clients
    one release behind) to allow for this more gradual update of
    workstations.
-   This applies to all the RTC clients including the Eclipse, VS.Net
    SCM CLI, Windows Shell and ISPF Clients. For clarity we also include
    the table below:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Server | Compatible Clients |  | CLM 5.0.x Server | RTC Eclipse Client 5.0.y, (x\>=y)RTC Eclipse Client v4.0.y or Later |  |  | RTC VS.Net Client v.5.0.y, x\>=y VS.Net Client v.4.0.y or later |  |  | RTC SCM CLI v.5.0.y, x\>=y RTC SCM CLI v.4.0.y or later |
|  | RTC ISPF Client v.5.0.y, x\>=y RTC ISPF Client v.4.0.y or later |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | RTC Windows Shell Client y, x\>=y RTC Windows Shell Client v.4.0.y or later |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | RTC MSSCCI Provider v.5.0.y, x\>=y RTC MSSCCI Provider v.4.0.y or later |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### C2. RTC Build System Toolkit

-   The Build System Toolkit is a 32 bit client that can be run on the
    RTC Server and the Client Operating Systems. Please see the
    downloads page for the specific executable on your platform. For the
    RTC Eclipse client platforms there is an Installation Manager
    install. For z/OS there is a SMP/E install. For IBM i there is a
    LICPGM install. For all other platforms there are Plain Zips.
-   The Build System Toolkit is supported using the the versions of Java
    that RTC supports on the selected install platform. When installed
    on z/OS, the Build System Toolkit is also supported using Java 7.

### C3. RTC SCM Command-Line Tool

-   The SCM Command-Line Tool is supported on all Server Platforms
    except for IBM i.

### C4. RTC ISPF Client and ISPF Gateway

-   The Rational Team Concert ISPF Client is supported on all zOS
    platforms as specified under Server Operating Systems.
-   Prior to RTC 4.0.5, the Rational Team Concert ISPF client required
    cURL, an open source tool supplied through IBM Ported Tools
    Supplementary Toolkit for z/OS. Information on IBM Ported Tools can
    be found at: [IBM Ported Tools for z/OS Product and Feature
    Information](http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/unix/ported/).
    If you already have IBM Ported Tools installed, cURL for z/OS is
    available by ordering the PTF for APAR OA2. Release 4.0.5 and later
    do not have this dependency.
-   For 4.0.5 the ISPF client supports the same Java versions as the CLM
    Server on z/OS. For 4.0.6 and later, the ISPF client supports those
    plus Java 7 on z/OS.
-   Information on the Supplementary Toolkit for z/OS can be found at
    [Supplement Toolkit for
    z/OS](http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/unix/ported/suptlk/index.html.).
-   Rational Team Concert uses the ISPF Gateway component of ISPF for
    access to z/OS files. For the ISPF Gateway component to function
    correctly, you must install a number of PTFs for the listed APARs.
    If you do not install the appropriate PTF, you might encounter
    problems with ISPF Gateway usage. For the supported ISPF releases,
    the PTFs are as follows:
    -   for APAR OA35689:
        -   z/OS 1.9: UA63763
        -   z/OS 1.10: UA59950
        -   z/OS 1.11: UA59951
        -   z/OS 1.12: UA59951
        -   z/OS 1.13: - code is at appropriate level
    -   for APAR OA38740:
        -   z/OS 1.10: UA65381
        -   z/OS 1.11: UA65382
        -   z/OS 1.12: UA65382
        -   z/OS 1.13: UA65383
    -   for APAR OA39666:
        -   z/OS 1.11: UA65909
        -   z/OS 1.12: UA65909
        -   z/OS 1.13: UA65910
    -   for APAR OA43014:
        -   z/OS 1.12: UA71732
        -   z/OS 1.13: UA71733
    -   for APAR OA43738
        -   z/OS 1.12: UA71471
        -   z/OS 1.13: UA71472
        -   z/OS 2.1: UA71473
    -   for APAR OA43888
        -   z/OS 2.1: UA71763
    -   for APAR OA44263:
        -   z/OS 1.12: UA72897
        -   z/OS 1.13: UA72898
        -   z/OS 2.1: UA72899

##### Server Host Operating System Notes

-   *Host Operating Systems are supported on x86-64, POWER, z/OS and
    SPARC hardware. Itanium is not supported.*
-   *CLM requires 64 bit server OS to host CLM applications. 32-bit
    servers are not supported except for small-scale evaluation or
    demonstration purposes.*
-   *The RRC Converter application will ***not*** run on AIX, IBM i,
    Linux for Power, Solaris or z/OS systems. The server-side
    converter.war, needed to view graphical artifacts, must be deployed
    on a supported Windows, x86 Linux or zLinux platform. If your RRC
    installation is on a platform not currently supported by the
    converter application, this document describes the delegated
    converter configuration option: [RM Converter Application
    Configuration and Troubleshooting
    Guide](https://jazz.net/library/article/1089).*
-   *[Recommended Fixes for the Rational Collaborative Lifecycle
    Management applications on z/OS and IBM
    i](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27043083)*
-   *For IBMi PTF's are required. For the latest IBM i Group PTFs, go to
    <http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/sline003.nsf/GroupPTFs?OpenView&view=GroupPTFs>.*
-   *IBM z/OS System z 1.10 and 1.9 are only supported if you have paid
    for an IBM Lifecycle Extension for z/OS as mentioned on
    <http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/support/zos_eos_dates.html>.*
-   *Rational Team Concert promotion and deployment support for z/OS
    require the REXX runtime or REXX alternate libraries
    (REXX.\***.SEAGLPA, or REXX.\***.SEAGALT). If you do not have either
    the REXX Library or the REXX Alternate Library installed, you can
    install the REXX Alternate Library to fulfill the REXX Library
    requirement. The REXX Alternate Library is shipped as part of the
    z/OS operating system beginning with release 1.9. The Alternate
    Library is also available as a free download from
    <http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/>.*
-   *Reminder - RRDI may be installed on a separate server (platform).
    Additional RRDI platforms are included in the list above.*
-   *"and future OS fixpacks" includes Service Releases (SR's) and
    Updates (RHEL). Fix pack is IBM terminology for a minor release that
    includes fixes (vs. features).*

### A2. Server Virtualization

conditionally supported under the following terms: 1 The operating
system being hosted in the virtualized environment must be supported in
a non-virtualized environment 1 Any defects reported are reproducible
outside the virtualization environment 1 Rational Support may not have
access to the virtualization environment and will attempt to reproduce
the issues reported on a non-virtualized environment or one of the
specific virtualization technologies listed above 1 No cluster support
is available for these VM's

    (Change and Configuration Management, Quality Management,
    Requirements Management) on one server for small deployments. Larger
    deployments or loads may require significantly more memory.
-   The Java virtual machine max heap memory setting is configured to
    -Xmx4000M for 64-bit platforms and -Xmx1200M for 32-bit platforms
    (for small-scale evaluation or demonstration purposes only). Note
    that the Java virtual machine heap size should only represent a
    fraction of the physical memory (RAM) of the server.
-   For 64-bit deployments where less memory is available, it is
    possible - although strongly discouraged - to configure the Java
    virtual machine memory size to a lower setting (e.g. -Xmx1200M to
    match the 32-bit setup) - be aware that it may results in memory
    outages and/or performance degradation. For the Tomcat installation,
    the server.startup script file to edit is located under
    JazzInstallDir/server/, and controlled by the line: set
    JAVA_OPTS=JAVA_OPTS -Xmx4000M. For a WebSphere Application Server
    installation, please consult the WebSphere Administrative Console,
    and modify Servers\>Application Servers\>server1\>Java and Process
    Management\>Process Definition\>Java Virtual Machine\>Maximum Heap
    Size.
-   Memory requirements can be reduced by running a subset of
    applications such as just CCM to support RTC-only functionality.
    Additionally if applications and/or the Jazz Team Server are running
    on different machines, memory requirements for specific machines may
    be reduced.

#### RRDI Memory Requirements

-   8 GB RAM. More memory generally improves performance; required
    memory depends on the number of concurrent users, amount of data
    being requested, and the size of the database. Optimum swap space is
    double the physical memory.

### A4. Network Infrastructure

-   IPv6
-   IPv4

#### A6.2 High Availability Database Support

When clustering we also suggest setting up High Availability support
with these databases:

-   **DB2 9.7 HADR** DB2 HADR is included with Enterprise Server Edition
    but requires additional DB2 licenses for anything other than cold
    standby. See note below.
-   **DB2 10.1 HADR** New for CLM 4.0.3 DB2 HADR is included with
    Enterprise Server Edition but requires additional DB2 licenses for
    anything other than cold standby. See note below.
-   **DB2 9 for z/OS 9.1**
-   **DB2 10 for z/OS 10.1** (with PTF UK77844)
-   **Oracle Real Application Clustering** (Oracle 11g Release 2)

##### Database Support Notes

-   Database support is 64-bit only to align with 64-bit server
    platforms.
-   WAS and DB2 bundles are only available on Passport Advantage and in
    the CLM Media (not on Jazz.net). Customers upgrading from CLM 3.0.1
    and 4.0.X are entitled to continue using DB2 9.7 as long as CLM
    supports that version.
-   The DB2 HADR functionality is included and can be used with the
    Limited Use Workgroup and Enterprise Server Editions. However, there
    must be entitlement coverage for the secondary/standby server. There
    is a 1:1 entitlement ratio for DB2 with the entitlement purchased by
    the customer of the bundling product. For eg. 500 PVUs of Portal
    entitles customer to use a maximum of 500 PVUs of DB2 in support of
    Portal. The entitlement requirement for the standby server depends
    on the standby configuration used, and is defined in the DB2
    license. ie. Hot standby requires equivalent entitlement as the
    Primary. Warm standby requires 100 PVUs/25 AUs, regardless of
    Primary. Cold standby server is free. Definition of hot/warm/cold
    standby configurations is also in the DB2 license.
-   Oracle is not supported for System z or IBM i
-   SQL Server is supported on Windows Server only

## C. Additional RTC Clients and Optional Tools

### C1.RTC Clients N-1 Compatibility

-   For upgrades, after upgrading the Server, teams may choose to
    gradually upgrade the clients. CLM supports N-1 (keeping the clients
    one release behind) to allow for this more gradual update of
    workstations.
-   This applies to all the RTC clients including the Eclipse, VS.Net
    SCM CLI, Windows Shell and ISPF Clients. For clarity we also include
    the table below:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Server | Compatible Clients |  | CLM 4.0.x Server | RTC Eclipse Client v4.0.y, (x\>=y)RTC Eclipse Client v3.0.y or Later |  |  | RTC VS.Net Client v.4.0.y, x\>=y VS.Net Client v.3.0.y or later |  |  | RTC SCM CLI v.4.0.y, x\>=y RTC SCM CLI v.3.0.y or later |
|  | RTC ISPF Client v.4.0.y, x\>=y RTC ISPF Client v.3.0.y or later |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | RTC Windows Shell Client v.4.0.y, x \>=y (this was introduced in 4.0) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | RTC MSSCCI Provider v.4.0.y, x \>=y (this was introduced in 4.0) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### C2. RTC Build System Toolkit

-   The Build System Toolkit is a client that can also be run on Server
    Operating Systems. It is supported on all CLM Server (Host Operating
    Systems) and all the RTC Eclipse Client platforms. For the RTC
    Eclipse client platforms there is an Installation Manager install.
    For all other platforms there are Plain Zips.

### C3. RTC SCM Command-Line Tool

-   The SCM Command-Line Tool is supported on all Server Platforms
    except for IBM i.

### C4. RTC ISPF Client and ISPF Gateway

-   The Rational Team Concert ISPF Client is supported on all zOS
    platforms as specified under Server Operating Systems.
-   The Rational Team Concert ISPF client requires cURL, an open source
    tool supplied through IBM Ported Tools Supplementary Toolkit for
    z/OS. Information on IBM Ported Tools can be found at: [IBM Ported
    Tools for z/OS Product and Feature
    Information](http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/unix/ported/).
    If you already have IBM Ported Tools installed, cURL for z/OS is
    available by ordering the PTF for APAR OA22944. Information on the
    Supplementary Toolkit for z/OS can be found at [Supplement Toolkit
    for
    z/OS](http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/unix/ported/suptlk/index.html.).
-   Rational Team Concert uses the ISPF Gateway component of ISPF for
    access to z/OS files. For the ISPF Gateway component to function

CLM appliucations integrate with each of the products listed below.

### D1. CLM Products Integrating With One Another

-   For 4.0.x versions all CLM products must be at the same 4.0.x level.
    If one product is upgraded to a new 4.0.x then all products must be
    upgraded whether they share a JTS or not.
-   The 4.0.x products can be integrated with products in the 3.0.x
    release as shown in the following table. Note that this excludes DNG
    which only integrates with other 4.0.x products at the same version
    level as DNG.
-   CLM v3.0.1.6 included critical fixes for high priority security
    issues so that version is recommended but not required.

## Generating your own system requirement report

Always up-to-date system requirement reports can be dynamically
generated using the [Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)
tool](http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html).
From the tool, you can select the product or solution and version that
you need. You can use filters to reduce the scope of the system
requirements, and to view the requirements for components including the
server-based CLM applications that are deployed on one or more servers
and various optional tools and clients.

## General Notes

-   From CLM 5.0 onward, Rational Requirements Composer (RRC) has been
    renamed to Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG)
-   Starting in CLM 5.0.2, Lifecycle Project Administration (LPA) is now
    a component of the Jazz Team Server (JTS). Prior to 5.0.2, it was a

## Generating your own system requirement report

Always up-to-date system requirement reports can be dynamically
generated using the [Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)
tool](http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html).
From the tool, you can select the product or solution and version that
you need. You can use filters to reduce the scope of the system
requirements, and to view the requirements for components including the
server-based CLM applications that are deployed on one or more servers
and various optional tools and clients.

## General Notes

-   From CLM 5.0 onward, Rational Requirements Composer (RRC) has been
    renamed to Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG)
-   Starting in CLM 5.0.2, Lifecycle Project Administration (LPA) is now
    a component of the Jazz Team Server (JTS). Prior to 5.0.2, it was a
    separate application. Because of this change, some steps of the
    upgrade procedure have changed. See [Migrating the LPA application
    from 4.0.x, 5.0 or 5.0.1 to 5.0.2 or
    higher](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/LifecycleProjectAdmin#Migrating_the_LPA_application_to).
-   **To activate the configuration management capabilities, Rational
    DOORS Next Generation and Rational Quality Manager require a
    special, no-cost activation key. See [Enabling configuration
    management in CLM 6.0.2
    applications](https://jazz.net/servlet/clm-cm/request-key?version=6.0.2)

## Generating your own system requirement report

Always up-to-date system requirement reports can be dynamically
generated using the [Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)
tool](http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html).
From the tool, you can select the product or solution and version that
you need. You can use filters to reduce the scope of the system
requirements, and to view the requirements for components including the
server-based CLM applications that are deployed on one or more servers
and various optional tools and clients.

## General Notes

-   From CLM 5.0 onward, Rational Requirements Composer (RRC) has been
    renamed to Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG)
-   Starting in CLM 5.0.2, Lifecycle Project Administration (LPA) is now
    a component of the Jazz Team Server (JTS). Prior to 5.0.2, it was a
    separate application. Because of this change, some steps of the
    upgrade procedure have changed. See [Migrating the LPA application
    from 4.0.x, 5.0 or 5.0.1 to 5.0.2 or
    higher](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/LifecycleProjectAdmin#Migrating_the_LPA_application_to).
-   **To activate the configuration management capabilities, Rational
    DOORS Next Generation and Rational Quality Manager require a
    special, no-cost activation key. See [Enabling configuration
    management in CLM 6.0.4
    applications](https://jazz.net/servlet/clm-cm/request-key?version=6.0.4)

## Generating your own system requirement report

Always up-to-date system requirement reports can be dynamically
generated using the [Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)
tool](http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html).
From the tool, you can select the product or solution and version that
you need. You can use filters to reduce the scope of the system
requirements, and to view the requirements for components including the
server-based CLM applications that are deployed on one or more servers
and various optional tools and clients.

## Languages

CLM is available in the following languages:

\* Chinese (Simplified)

\* Chinese (Traditional)

\* French

\* German

\* Italian

\* Japanese

\* Portuguese (Brazil)

\* Spanish

\* Czech

\* Hungarian

\* Korean

\* Polish

\* Russian

\* Turkish

## General Notes

-   From CLM 5.0 onward, Rational Requirements Composer (RRC) has been
    renamed to Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG)
-   Starting in CLM 5.0.2, Lifecycle Project Administration (LPA) is now
    a component of the Jazz Team Server (JTS). Prior to 5.0.2, it was a
    separate application. Because of this change, some steps of the
    upgrade procedure have changed. See [Migrating the LPA application
    from 4.0.x, 5.0 or 5.0.1 to 5.0.2 or
    higher](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/LifecycleProjectAdmin#Migrating_the_LPA_application_to).
-   **To activate the configuration management capabilities, Rational
    DOORS Next Generation and Rational Quality Manager require a
    special, no-cost activation key. See [Enabling configuration
    management in CLM 6.0.6
    applications](https://jazz.net/servlet/clm-cm/request-key?version=6.0.6)

The system requirements are broken down into various components
including the server-based CLM applications that are deployed on one or
more servers and various optional tools and clients. Server Requirements
are further broken down into Non-Clustered and Clustered support where
applicable. BLUEPlease Note as announced with CLM v4.0.6: IBM will be
simplifying the approach to high availability for the Rational CLM
platform. Customers and IBM are increasingly using other technologies,
such as cloud and virtualization strategies, that provide a solution
which adapts to business demands for both availability and scale in a
cost-effective manner. Please see [Approaches to implementing high
availability and disaster recovery for Rational Jazz
environments](ApproachesToImplementingHAAndDR) for guidance and best
practice. IBM will be removing support for WebSphere Application Server
based application clustering from the CLM platform. For further details,
please contact Support or your Technical Sales representative. ENDCOLOR

##### Server Host Operating System Notes

-   *Host Operating Systems are supported on x86-64, POWER, z/OS and
    SPARC hardware. Itanium is not supported.*
-   *CLM requires 64 bit server OS to host CLM applications. 32-bit
    servers are not supported except for small-scale evaluation or
    demonstration purposes.* BLUEStarting with CLM 4.0.5, RRDI (2.0.5)
    also requires 64 bit servers. ENDCOLOR
-   *The RRC Converter application will ***not*** run on AIX, IBM i,
    Linux for Power, Solaris or z/OS systems. The server-side
    converter.war, needed to view graphical artifacts, must be deployed
    on a supported Windows, x86 Linux or zLinux platform. If your RRC
    installation is on a platform not currently supported by the
    converter application, this document describes the delegated
    converter configuration option: [RM Converter Application
    Configuration and Troubleshooting
    Guide](https://jazz.net/library/article/1089).*
-   *[Recommended Fixes for the Rational Collaborative Lifecycle
    Management applications on z/OS and IBM
    i](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27043083)*
-   *For IBMi PTF's are required. For the latest IBM i Group PTFs, go to
    <http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/sline003.nsf/GroupPTFs?OpenView&view=GroupPTFs>.*
-   *IBM z/OS System z 1.10 and 1.9 are only supported if you have paid
    for an IBM Lifecycle Extension for z/OS as mentioned on
    <http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/support/zos_eos_dates.html>.*
-   *Rational Team Concert promotion and deployment support for z/OS
    require the REXX runtime or REXX alternate libraries
    (REXX.\***.SEAGLPA, or REXX.\***.SEAGALT). If you do not have either
    the REXX Library or the REXX Alternate Library installed, you can
    install the REXX Alternate Library to fulfill the REXX Library
    requirement. The REXX Alternate Library is shipped as part of the
    z/OS operating system beginning with release 1.9. The Alternate
    Library is also available as a free download from
    <http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/>.*
-   *Reminder - RRDI may be installed on a separate server (platform).
    Additional RRDI platforms are included in the list above.*
-   *"and future OS fixpacks" includes Service Releases (SR's) and
    Updates (RHEL). Fix pack is IBM terminology for a minor release that
    includes fixes (vs. features).*

### A2. Server Virtualization

#### A2.1 Server Virtualization Non-Clustered Support

BLUENew for CLM 4.0.5ENDCOLOR - For the supported Server Operating
Systems above, virtualization is now supported using any of the related
IBM SWG supported hypervisors listed in the [Server Virtualization
Policy for IBM
Software](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/virtualization_policy.html).

Notes:

-   This policy applies only to non-clustered CLM 4.0.5 applications.
-   Please check that the system requirements or release notes of the
    respective hypervisor (edition and version) supports the host
    operating system (edition and version) you plan to use for deploying
    the CLM application(s).

#### A2.2 Server Virtualization Clustered Support

Supported host operating systems may be virtualized for application
clustering using **only** the following hypervisor with operating system
options:

| Server Virtualization | with Operating System(s) | CLM Server | RRDI | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| IBM PowerVM Hypervisor (LPAR, DPAR, Micro-Partition) any supported version and future fix packs | AIX 6.1, 7.1 | 64 bit | Not Supported |  |

### A3. Memory Requirements

#### CLM Server Memory Requirements

-   For CLM 4.0 and later you need a 64-bit operating system and a
    minimum of 4 GB of server memory allocated to the Java virtual
    machine running the Jazz Team Server and all three applications
    (Change and Configuration Management, Quality Management,
    Requirements Management) on one server for small deployments. Larger
    deployments or loads may require significantly more memory.
-   The Java virtual machine max heap memory setting is configured to
    -Xmx4000M for 64-bit platforms and -Xmx1200M for 32-bit platforms
    (for small-scale evaluation or demonstration purposes only). Note
    that the Java virtual machine heap size should only represent a
    fraction of the physical memory (RAM) of the server.
-   For 64-bit deployments where less memory is available, it is
    possible - although strongly discouraged - to configure the Java
    virtual machine memory size to a lower setting (e.g. -Xmx1200M to
    match the 32-bit setup) - be aware that it may results in memory
    outages and/or performance degradation. For the Tomcat installation,
    the server.startup script file to edit is located under
    JazzInstallDir/server/, and controlled by the line: set
    JAVA_OPTS=JAVA_OPTS -Xmx4000M. For a WebSphere Application Server
    installation, please consult the WebSphere Administrative Console,
    and modify Servers\>Application Servers\>server1\>Java and Process
    Management\>Process Definition\>Java Virtual Machine\>Maximum Heap
    Size.
-   Memory requirements can be reduced by running a subset of
    applications such as just CCM to support RTC-only functionality.
    Additionally if applications and/or the Jazz Team Server are running
    on different machines, memory requirements for specific machines may
    be reduced.

#### RRDI Server Memory Requirements

-   8 GB RAM. More memory generally improves performance; required
    memory depends on the number of concurrent users, amount of data
    being requested, and the size of the database. Optimum swap space is
    double the physical memory.

### A4. Network Infrastructure

-   IPv6
-   IPv4

### A5. Application Servers ---++++ A5.1 Application Server Non-Clustered Support

The following application servers can be used to host CLM applications

#### A6.2 High Availability Database Support

When clustering we also suggest setting up High Availability support
with these databases:

-   **DB2 9.7 HADR** DB2 HADR is included with Enterprise Server Edition
    but requires additional DB2 licenses for anything other than cold
    standby. See note below.
-   **DB2 10.1 HADR** BLUENew for CLM v4.0.3ENDCOLOR DB2 HADR is
    included with Enterprise Server Edition but requires additional DB2
    licenses for anything other than cold standby. See note below.
-   **DB2 9 for z/OS 9.1**
-   **DB2 10 for z/OS 10.1** (with PTF UK77844)
-   **Oracle Real Application Clustering** (Oracle 11g Release 2)

##### Database Support Notes

-   Database support is 64-bit only to align with 64-bit server
    platforms. For RRDI the 32-bit database client library is required
    (even though the database server is 64-bit).
-   WAS and DB2 bundles are only available on Passport Advantage and in
    the CLM Media (not on Jazz.net). Customers upgrading from CLM 3.0.1
    and 4.0.X are entitled to continue using DB2 9.7 as long as CLM
    supports that version.
-   The DB2 HADR functionality is included and can be used with the
    Limited Use Workgroup and Enterprise Server Editions. However, there
    must be entitlement coverage for the secondary/standby server. There
    is a 1:1 entitlement ratio for DB2 with the entitlement purchased by
    the customer of the bundling product. For eg. 500 PVUs of Portal
    entitles customer to use a maximum of 500 PVUs of DB2 in support of
    Portal. The entitlement requirement for the standby server depends
    on the standby configuration used, and is defined in the DB2
    license. ie. Hot standby requires equivalent entitlement as the
    Primary. Warm standby requires 100 PVUs/25 AUs, regardless of
    Primary. Cold standby server is free. Definition of hot/warm/cold
    standby configurations is also in the DB2 license.
-   Oracle is not supported for System z or IBM i
-   SQL Server is supported on Windows Server only
-   JTS Setup for Microsoft SQL Server does not support Integrated
    Authentication. You will be unable to install CLM in your
    environment. Ensure that server security is in mixed mode. To
    validate this, check server security -- it should be set to SQL
    Server and Windows Authentication Mode.

## C. Additional RTC Clients and Optional Tools

### C1.RTC Clients N-1 Compatibility

-   For upgrades, after upgrading the Server, teams may choose to
    gradually upgrade the clients. CLM supports N-1 (keeping the clients
    one release behind) to allow for this more gradual update of
    workstations.
-   This applies to all the RTC clients including the Eclipse, VS.Net
    SCM CLI, Windows Shell and ISPF Clients. For clarity we also include
    the table below:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Server | Compatible Clients |  | CLM 4.0.x Server | RTC Eclipse Client v4.0.y, (x\>=y)RTC Eclipse Client v3.0.y or Later |  |  | RTC VS.Net Client v.4.0.y, x\>=y VS.Net Client v.3.0.y or later |  |  | RTC SCM CLI v.4.0.y, x\>=y RTC SCM CLI v.3.0.y or later |
|  | RTC ISPF Client v.4.0.y, x\>=y RTC ISPF Client v.3.0.y or later |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | RTC Windows Shell Client v.4.0.y, x \>=y (this was introduced in 4.0) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | RTC MSSCCI Provider v.4.0.y, x \>=y (this was introduced in 4.0) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### C2. RTC Build System Toolkit

-   The Build System Toolkit is a 32 bit client that can be run on the
    RTC Server and the Client Operating Systems. Please see the
    downloads page for the specific executable on your platform. For the
    RTC Eclipse client platforms there is an Installation Manager
    install. For z/OS there is a SMP/E install. For IBM i there is a
    LICPGM install. For all other platforms there are Plain Zips.
-   The Build System Toolkit is supported using the the versions of Java
    that RTC supports on the selected install platform. When installed
    on z/OS, the Build System Toolkit is also supported using Java 7.

### C3. RTC SCM Command-Line Tool

-   The SCM Command-Line Tool is supported on all Server Platforms
    except for IBM i.

### C4. RTC ISPF Client and ISPF Gateway

-   The Rational Team Concert ISPF Client is supported on all zOS
    platforms as specified under Server Operating Systems.
-   Prior to RTC 4.0.5, the Rational Team Concert ISPF client required
    cURL, an open source tool supplied through IBM Ported Tools
    Supplementary Toolkit for z/OS. Information on IBM Ported Tools can
    be found at: [IBM Ported Tools for z/OS Product and Feature
    Information](http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/unix/ported/).
    If you already have IBM Ported Tools installed, cURL for z/OS is
    available by ordering the PTF for APAR OA2. BLUERelease 4.0.5 and
    later do not have this dependency. ENDCOLOR
-   For 4.0.5 the ISPF client supports the same Java versions as the CLM
    Server on z/OS. BLUEFor 4.0.6, the ISPF client supports those plus
    Java 7 on z/OS. ENDCOLOR
-   Information on the Supplementary Toolkit for z/OS can be found at
    [Supplement Toolkit for
    z/OS](http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/unix/ported/suptlk/index.html.).

<!-- -->

-   Rational Team Concert uses the ISPF Gateway component of ISPF for
    access to z/OS files. For the ISPF Gateway component to function
    correctly, you must install a number of PTFs for the listed APARs.
    If you do not install the appropriate PTF, you might encounter
    problems with ISPF Gateway usage. For the supported ISPF releases,
    the PTFs are as follows:
    -   for APAR OA35689:
        -   z/OS 1.9: UA63763
        -   z/OS 1.10: UA59950
        -   z/OS 1.11: UA59951
        -   z/OS 1.12: UA59951
        -   z/OS 1.13: - code is at appropriate level
    -   for APAR OA38740:
        -   z/OS 1.10: UA65381
        -   z/OS 1.11: UA65382
        -   z/OS 1.12: UA65382
        -   z/OS 1.13: UA65383
    -   for APAR OA39666:
        -   z/OS 1.11: UA65909
        -   z/OS 1.12: UA65909
        -   z/OS 1.13: UA65910

## D. CLM Integrations, Migrations and Adapters

CLM appliucations integrate with each of the products listed below.

### D1. CLM Products Integrating With One Another

-   For 4.0.x versions all CLM products must be at the same 4.0.x level.
    If one product is upgraded to a new 4.0.x then all products must be
    upgraded whether they share a JTS or not.
-   The 4.0.x products can be integrated with products in the 3.0.x
    release as shown in the following table. Note that this excludes DNG
    which only integrates with other 4.0.x products at the same version
    level as DNG.
-   CLM v3.0.1.6 iFix2 includes fixes for high priority security issues
    so that version is recommended but not required.

# Rational solution for Collaborative Lifecycle Management Upgrade Guide [rational-solution-for-collaborative-lifecycle-management-upgrade-guide]

DKGRAY Authors: Main.RosaNaranjo Build basis: CLM 4.0.x ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

RED This guide has been updated for CLM 4.0.6ENDCOLOR

This CLM Upgrade Guide includes a step-by-step follow-up to the [CLM
2011 Upgrade Workshop](https://jazz.net/library/article/662), a
troubleshooting guide and a FAQ. It provides a high-level overview of
the CLM Upgrade process. The upgrade process was greatly improved with
the CLM 2012 release and with additional improvements in subsequent
releases such as CLM 4.0.6. For example, there is no longer the need to
export and import any CLM repository databases and it is no longer
necessary to run JTS setup after an application is upgraded or register
upgraded applications with an existing JTS.

The CLM 2011 Upgrade workshop used a fully distributed WAS deployment of
all 3 CLM applications along with a DB2 server. At the end of the CLM
2011 upgrade workshop, the deployment topology looked as follows:

The topology will remain unchanged after the upgrade. The only
difference after the upgrade would be that the 3.0.1 software is
replaced with 4.0.x software.

We want to start the upgrade by [planning the
upgrade](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m6/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_planning_upgrade.html).
The CLM applications (RTC, RQM, and RRC) can be upgraded in any order.
However, keep in mind that the first application upgrade phase will also
include the upgrade of the JTS as the first component to be upgraded. If
you have a multi-application deployment, read the [Planning the
Upgrade](#PlanningTheUpgrade) section below.

In this article, I will upgrade JTS first along with the RRC
application, RTC second, and lastly, RQM. In order to understand the
upgrade process, we want to use the Interactive Upgrade guide (IUG)
available in the [4.0.x Infocenter Upgrade and Migrating
book](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m6/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_clm_upgrade.html).
In this example, I chose to generate three separate upgrade guides.
However, you can choose to generate one guide for all four applications
and include RRDI if you have it deployed in your 3.0.1.x environment.

At a high level, the upgrade outline will look as follows:

1 Complete the Planning Checklist 1 Abbreviations for applications and
directories 1 Known issue: Base Licenses are not installed with Trial
Keys package 1 \[Optional\] Staging a test environment for the upgrade
process **Note: This is not in the outline anymore but should be.** 1
Install CLM 4.0.x 1 Optional: Online migration of quality management
data 1 Backup the WebSphere Application Server profile 1 Uninstall the
previously installed applications from WebSphere Application Server 1
Update JAZZ_HOME and log4j.configuration custom properties 1 Stop the
WebSphere Application Server 1 Clean up the WebSphere Application Server
temp directories 1 Clean up the logs directory 1 Backup the indices 1
Backup the database 1 Verify index locations 1 Run the upgrade script 1
Start the WebSphere Application Server 1 Deploy the 4.0.x war files in
WebSphere Application Server 1 Start the applications 1 Version 4.0.x
and licenses 1 \[In case of RM\] Migrating the Requirements Management

Development Intelligence 1 Redeploying predefined templates 1
Verification Checklist

## Workshop Environment

Windows 2008 R2 64-bit, WebSphere Application Server v7.0.0.15 or
higher, DB2 9.7 Enterprise Server, RTC 3.0.1.3, RQM 3.0.1.3, and RRC
3.0.1.3

**NOTE:** CLM 2012 only supports 64 bit OS platforms. There is no 32-bit
support. For more information, see [CLM System
Requirements](DeploymentInstallingUpgradingAndMigrating)

The workshop environment assumes the CLM applications are all deployed
on a single Microsoft Windows machine (perhaps a VM) but distributed
across 4 application server profiles in order to simulate a distributed
topology. However, the workshop can be performed across multiple
machines (Linux or Windows) just as easily. In this environment, we do
not need to be concerned with synchronization of the clocks on all
machines hosting a CLM application. This step appears as part of the IUG
but is not covered here.

## Reporting Considerations

In CLM 2011, the common data warehouse (DW) and RRDI v1.0.2 were
introduced. By now, most users will have configured a DW at the time
that they installed or upgraded to 3.0.1.x, or shortly thereafter. If
you have not configured a DW yet, you should wait to do so until after
you upgrade all applications in your topology to v4.0.x. See this topic:
<http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m6/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_ugrade_configure_dw_late.html>

If you are using RRDI v1.0.2 or later, you will need to upgrade to RRDI
v2.0.x to work with CLM 4.0.x. Upgrade RRDI to 2.0 **AFTER** upgrading
to CLM 2012. For more information, visit the [Upgrading
RRDI](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m6/topic/com.ibm.rational.rrdi.admin.doc/topics/c_upgrading_rrdi.html)
topic. **NOTE:** This upgrade order is a change from previous
recommendations made for CLM 2012.

\#PlanningTheUpgrade

## Planning the Upgrade

Prior to upgrading to CLM 4.0.x, you should read the following topics:

<http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m6/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_planning_upgrade.html>

Upgrading from version 2 is a two-step process. First, upgrade to
version 3.0.1.6 or higher and then upgrade to CLM 4.0.x. See [Upgrading
from version
2](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m6/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_upgrade_to_301.html).

Pay attention to the bulleted list called "Important Notes" generated by
the Interactive Upgrade Guide.

## Licensing

If you are still using Early Access licenses with a 3.0.1.x deployment,
then the upgrade to 40x will convert these licenses to 4.0.xx Early
Access licenses. In a 'real'customer scenario with a 3.0.1.x deployment,
you most probably have floating, token, or Authorized User Single
Install client access licenses (CALs).

The upgrade process will not convert your existing CALs from 3.0 to
4.0.x. As part of the 4.0.x installation of the Jazz Team Server (JTS),
you will need to install the 'Required Base License Key' package. See
screenshot for what this looks like in Installation Manager.

This package installs Early Access trial licenses. Once the Early Access
trial licenses are installed, they still need to be activated. In a
distributed deployment, this should be done when the JTS is upgraded and
prior to subsequently upgrading any other registered applications. The
4.0.x applications only work with 4.0 licenses. The Early Access trial
licenses once activated allow you to use the 4.0.x applicatons until you
have a chance to obtain your purchased CALs.

Review the section in the generated interactive upgrade guide called
**Version 4.0.x and licenses** for the most up to date information.

## Upgrade RRC and JTS

Begin by generating an upgrade guide for RRC using the [4.0.x Infocenter
Upgrade and Migrating
Guide](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m6/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_clm_upgrade.html).
Select 'Jazz Team Server, Requirements Management, CLM 3.0.1 or any fix
pack of that version, I distribute applications on multiple servers,
Yes, I can mount shared directories or drives, Microsoft Windows, IBM
WebSphere Application Server, IBM DB2, Yes, I have configured data
warehouse in CLM 3.0.1, No (RRDI), No (integrate with other products).

Proceed with the following steps: (replace '40x' below with a name
compatible with your environment)

-   Install CLM 40x JTS to c:\upgradews\JTS40x
-   Install CLM 40x RRC to c:\upgradews\RRC40x
-   Backup the JTS WAS profile on AppSrv04 and RRC WAS profile on
    AppSrv03
-   Backup the JTS and DW database.
-   Backup the JTS index files
-   Uninstall the JTS application from AppSrv04
    -   Remove jts.war, admin.war and clmhelp.war
-   Update the JAZZ_HOME and log4j properties to point to the JTS40
    server installation directory. JAZZ_HOME =
    <file:///C:/UpgradeWS/IBM/JTS40/server/conf>

log4j.configuration=
<file:///C:/UpgradeWS/IBM/JTS40/server/conf/startup_log4j.properties>

-   Stop AppSrv04
-   Clean up the temp directories for AppSrv04.
    -   Delete
        C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv04\temp\\server1\jts_war
    -   C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv04\temp\\server1\admin_war
    -   C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv04\temp\\server1\clmhelp_war
    -   If it exists, delete
        C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv04\wscache\jts_war
    -   If it exists, delete
        C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv04\wscache\admin_war
    -   If it exists, delete
        C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv04\wscache\clmhelp_war
-   Clean up the logs. Make a backup copy of the existing jts**.log,
    etl**.log and admin\*.log files. Then delete the existing logs so as
    to start with fresh logs with the 40 JTS and Admin applications.
-   Uninstall the RRC application from AppSrv03
    -   Remove rrc.war and converter.war
-   Update the JAZZ_HOME and log4j properties to point to the RRC40
    server installation directory. JAZZ_HOME =
    <file:///C:/UpgradeWS/IBM/RRC40/server/conf>

log4j.configuration=
<file:///C:/UpgradeWS/IBM/RRC40/server/conf/startup_log4j.properties>

-   Stop AppSrv03
-   Clean up the temp directories for AppSrv03.
    -   Delete
        C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv04\temp\\server1\rdm_war
    -   C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv04\temp\\server1\converter_war
    -   If it exists, delete
        C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv04\wscache\rdm_war
    -   If it exists, delete
        C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv04\wscache\converter_war
-   Clean up the logs. Make a backup copy of the existing rdm**.log and
    rrdg**.log files. Then, delete the existing logs so as to start
    fresh logs with the 40 RM application.

<!-- -->

-   REDNot needed if upgrading from 3.0.1.6ENDCOLORVerify the Index
    locations In both Tomcat and Websphere Application Server
    deployments, it is important to pay attention to your index file
    locations within the 3.0.1 teamserver.properties
    (\_3.0.1_install*dir\server\conf\\*) directory. There are 2 index
    file locations given in the following two properties:
    -   com.ibm.team.fulltext.index.location
        -   For Websphere, the default relative path value for full-text
            indices will actually be located relative to the path of the
            WAS profile hosting the application and not relative to your
            local installation, for example
            C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv04
        -   The fulltext index file location should always be an
            absolute path location.
    -   com.ibm.jfs.index.root.directory
        -   this JFS indices can use the JAZZ_HOME property if its value
            is left as the default relative path.

<!-- -->

-   RED **Note:** ENDCOLOR The indices from the previous release MUST be
    usable by the upgrade process. Both index file locations will get
    merged into your new configuration files as part of the upgrade
    script execution below. If the fulltext index location is relative,
    for example,
    com.ibm.team.fulltext.index.location=conf/jts/indices/workitemindex,
    indices must be moved to an absolute location. Perform this step
    prior to running the upgrade script. Change the relative path to the
    absolute path of the index location. In our workshop environment, it
    should be
    com.ibm.team.fulltext.index.location=c\\\\upgradews\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\profiles\\appsrv04\\conf\\jts\\indices\\workitemindex
    During the *repotools-rm* upgrade script execution, this will enable
    a copy of the indices to take place. . Verify that artifact search
    works, once the upgraded application is brought online.

<!-- -->

-   In order to ensure that the indices are usable, a repotools -reindex
    it is often run. There is a natural expectation that this will
    recreate an index. This is true but this causes an issue with
    upgrade: when repotools -reindex is run, upon completion it adds a
    reindexing request to the indexing queue. When the server next
    starts, it is read, and triggers reindexing - the extent of which is
    not usually comprehendable.

<!-- -->

-   Therefore the correct way to rebuild an index is in 3.x, prior to
    upgrade is:
    1.  Stop CLM 3.x 2. Change your teamserver.properties path for the
        indices to a new path, not under the 3.x installation, for
        example c\\\\CLMindices\\Instance1\\indices 3. Delete the
        existing indices directory, see above for details of where the
        relative path location defaults to 4. Start CLM 3.x 5. Wait for
        indexing to complete by ensuring all \_\_ values within
        <https://yourURI/jts/indexing> are set to 0, for example: 0 6.
        Stop CLM 3.x 7. Upgrade JTS, ensuring that when you run
        repotools-jts -upgrade, the teamserver.properties for both index
        locations is set to the new path. See below for a more detail on
        running this step.

<!-- -->

-   Go to the JTS 40 installation directory and run the jts_upgrade
    script. This will migrate the JTS configuration files from 301x
    to 40. Cd c:\upgradews\ibm\jts40\server Run upgrade\jts\jts_upgrade
    -oldJTSHome c:\upgradews\ibm\jts301x\server\conf updateTomcatFiles
    no During this time, the script will update the configuration files,
    add tables to your existing JTS database and upgrade the data
    warehouse schema. **NOTE:** During the execution of the upgrade
    script, a prompt for review of the JTS teamserver.properties will be
    presented. At this point, change the location of the index files to
    an absolute path of a stable location. A stable location is one that
    will not be deleted as part of an application uninstall for example.
    The upgrade script will perform a copy of the indices if there is an
    update during the prompt for review. For example,
    com.ibm.team.fulltext.indexLocation=JTS_4.0_install_dir/server/conf/jts/indices/workitemindex
    where JTS_4.0_install_dir is the location where Jazz Team Server 4.0
    application is installed. **NOTE:** If the script prompts for a
    re-index or rebuildtextindices operation, this is an un-necessary
    step that has been observed intermittently in test. It can be safely
    skipped. In large repositories, this will save you alot of time.
    Your indices from v301 are compatible with v40. And, if you followed
    the instructions above, the indices should be located at the
    locations identified by the 2 properties:
    com.ibm.team.fulltext.index.location,
    com.ibm.jfs.index.root.directory. If artifact search works after the
    upgrade, then your indices are fine.
-   Start AppSrv04
-   Deploy the 4.0 JTS WAR files.
    -   There will be 3 WAR files to deploy: jts, admin and clmhelp. For
        details on the steps for deploying these WAR files to WAS, see
        this topic:
        <http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m6/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_deploy_was.html>
-   Start the JTS applications: JTS, Admin and CLMHelp
-   Install and Activate the licenses.
    -   Open a web browser and go to the following URL:
        <https://jts.clm.upgrade.ws:9446/jts/admin#action=com.ibm.team.repository.admin.manageLicenses>
    -   Activate, at a minimum, the following licenses: RRC Analyst, RRC
        Contributor, RQM Quality Professional, RQM Contributor, RTC
        Developer, RTC Build System, RTC Contributor **NOTE:** If you
        have v30 floating, token or Authorized Single User Licenses
        installed, install the v40 equivalents at this time. By default,
        only Early Access (EA) licenses are installed with the Required
        Base license keys package. If you have one of the other types of
        licenses in use, there is no automatic license assignment for
        any user from that license type to the EA license. But, if you
        install the v40 floating license and had v30 floating licenses,
        then there will be automatic license assignment done for all
        users in the system.
-   Switch to the RRC 40 Installation environment and run the rm_upgrade
    script. This will migrate the RRC configuration files from 301x
    to 40. Cd c:\upgradews\ibm\rrc40\server Run upgrade\rdm\rm_upgrade
    -oldJTSHome c:\upgradews\ibm\jts301\server\conf -updateTomcatFiles
    no -newJTSHome=c:\upgradews\ibm\jts40\server\conf
    -oldApplicationHome=c:\upgradews\ibm\rrc301\server\conf **Note:**
    The log file for the command launched by the upgrade script will be
    located in the newJTSHome directory, not the RM server installation
    directory.
-   Start AppSrv03
-   Deploy the 4.0 RRC WAR files.
    -   There will be 2 WAR files to deploy: rdm, and converter. For
        details on the steps for deploying these WAR files to WAS, see
        this topic:
        <http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m6/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_deploy_was.html>
-   Start the RM applications: RDM, and Converter
-   Make sure all other CLM applications associated with the JTS in this
    environment are all running.
-   Make sure that the JazzAdmin user has a v40 license assigned and
    activated prior to starting the RM Online migration. Go to the
    License Key Management page and the Users page of the JTS admin UI:
    <https://jts.clm.upgrade.ws:9446/jts/admin>
-   Run the RM Online Migration wizard.
-   REDNo longer needed with 4.0.6ENDCOLORRun a publish service
    initialize:
    <https://rrc.clm.upgrade.ws:9445/rdm/publish/initialize>. This will
    publish new templates for use with RRDG.
-   Redeploying predefined templates
    -   A project template called "Base" in previous versions was
        renamed to "Requirements Templates for Testers" in version
        4.0.6. To continue using this template after upgrade, you must
        update the lifecycle project templates. For detailed
        information, see Creating lifecycle projects from a template.

When the upgrade is complete, proceed with the verification steps listed
here:
<http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m6/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_update_post-mig_verif.html>

In addition, it is recommended that you verify the following:

-   All existing registered applications are operational. For example,
    start the application servers that are hosting RTC, RRC and RQM and
    verify that they are working with the upgraded JTS.
-   **NOTE:** In the workshop environment, we are running with RQM
    3.0.1.3. Thus, we can proceed with the next step. If you are not
    running RQM 3.0.1.3, you will need to upgrade to that level in order
    for the RQM Java ETLs to run properly with a 4.0 DW schema. See the
    Planning the upgrade section for more details.
-   Run the data collection jobs and check the status for any errors.
    The data collection jobs must be run from the JTS Admin UI Reports
    page.
    <https://jts.clm.upgrade.ws:9446/jts/admin#action=com.ibm.team.reportsManagement.etlConfig>
    -   Run the following action: Run all data warehouse collection jobs
        for all jobs. The ETLs for applications that have been upgraded
        will then take care of performing any necessary migration of
        data in the data warehouse repository.
-   Search for artifacts within the registered applications to ensure
    the indices are all valid.
-   Run diagnostics on each server and verify the diagnostics complete
    successfully.

## Upgrade RTC

Next, generate an upgrade guide for Rational Team Concert. Select Change
and Configuration Management, CLM 3.0.1 or any fix pack of that version,
I distribute my applications on multiple servers, Yes, I can mount
shared directories or drives, Microsoft Windows, IBM WebSphere
Application Server, IBM DB2, Yes, I have configured data warehouse in
CLM 3.0.1, No (RRDI), No (integrate with other products).

Proceed with the following steps: (replace '40x' below with a name
compatible with your environment)

-   install CLM 40x RTC to c:\upgradews\RTC40
-   Backup the RTC WAS profile on AppSrv01
-   Backup the RTC database
-   Uninstall the RTC application from AppSrv01
-   Update the JAZZ_HOME and log4j properties to point to the RTC40
    server installation directory. JAZZ_HOME =
    <file:///C:/UpgradeWS/IBM/RTC40/server/conf>

log4j.configuration=
<file:///C:/UpgradeWS/IBM/RTC40/server/conf/startup_log4j.properties>

-   Stop AppSrv01
-   Clean up the temp directories for AppSrv01.
    -   Delete
        C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv01\temp\\server1\jazz_war
    -   If it exists, delete
        C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv01\wscache\jazz_war
-   Clean up the logs. Make a backup copy of the existing jazz\*.log
    files. Delete the existing log files.
-   Verify the Index locations Not needed if upgrading from 3.0.1.6 In a
    WAS deployment, it is important to pay attention to your index file
    locations in the 3.0.1 teamserver.properties file, which is located
    in 3.0.1_install_dir\server\conf\\ directory. There are 2 index file
    locations given in the following two properties:
    com.ibm.team.fulltext.index.location,
    com.ibm.jfs.index.root.directory. The JFS indices
    (com.ibm.jfs.index.root.directory) uses the JAZZ_HOME property if
    its value is left as the default relative path. The fulltext indices
    (com.ibm.team.fulltext.index.location), if left as the default
    relative path value, will actually be located relative to the path
    of the WAS profile hosting the application, i.e.
    C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv01. You may have
    assumed it was relative to your local installation. In a WAS
    deployment, the fulltext index file location should always be an
    absolute path location. Both index file locations will get merged
    into your new configuration files as part of the upgrade script
    execution below. If the fulltext index location is relative, for
    example,
    com.ibm.team.fulltext.index.location=conf/jts/indices/workitemindex,
    perform this step prior to running the upgrade script. Change the
    relative path to the absolute path of the index location. In our
    workshop environment, it should be
    com.ibm.team.fulltext.index.location=c:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv01\conf\jazz\indices\workitemindex
    During the upgrade script execution, this will enable a copy of the
    indices to take place. If the 301x index locations already contained
    absolute paths and pointed to a stable location, then no further
    action is necessary. Verify that artifact search works, once the
    upgraded application is brought online.
-   Run the upgrade script. This will migrate the RTC configuration
    files from 301x to 40. Cd c:\upgradews\ibm\rtc40\server Run
    upgrade\jazz\ccm_upgrade
    -newJTSHome=c:\upgradews\ibm\jts40\server\conf
    -oldApplicationHome=c:\upgradews\ibm\rtc301\server\conf
    updateTomcatFiles no During this time, the script will update the
    configuration files and add tables to your existing RTC database.
    **NOTE:** During the execution of the upgrade script, a prompt for
    review of the CCM teamserver.properties will be presented. At this
    point, change the location of the index files to an absolute path of
    a stable location. A stable location is one that will not be deleted
    as part of an application uninstall for example. The upgrade script
    will perform a copy of the indices if there is an update during the
    prompt for review. For example,
    com.ibm.team.fulltext.indexLocation=CCM_4.0_install_dir/server/conf/jts/indices/workitemindex
    where CCM_4.0_install_dir is the location where CCM 4.0 application
    is installed. **NOTE:** If the script prompts for a re-index or
    rebuildtextindices operation, this is an un-necessary step that has
    been observed intermittently in test. It can be safely skipped. In
    large repositories, this will save you alot of time. Your indices
    from v301 are compatible with v40. And, if you followed the
    instructions above, the indices should be located at the locations
    identified by the 2 properties:
    com.ibm.team.fulltext.index.location,
    com.ibm.jfs.index.root.directory. If artifact search works after the
    upgrade, then your indices are fine.
-   Start AppSrv01
-   Deploy the 4.0.x RTC WAR file.
    -   There will be 1 WAR files to deploy: jazz. For details on the
        steps for deploying these WAR files to WAS, see this topic:
        <http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m6/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_deploy_was.html>
-   Start the RTC application: Jazz
-   Stop and restart AppSrv01 When the upgrade is complete, proceed with
    the verification steps listed here:
    <http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m6/topic/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_update_post-mig_verif.html>

In addition, it is recommended that you verify the following:

-   All existing registered applications are operational.
-   Run the data collection jobs and check the status for any errors.
    The data collection jobs must be run from the JTS Admin UI Reports
    page.
    <https://jts.clm.upgrade.ws:9446/jts/admin#action=com.ibm.team.reportsManagement.etlConfig>
    -   Run the following action: Run all data warehouse collection jobs
        for all jobs. The ETLs for applications that have been upgraded
        will then take care of performing any necessary migration of
        data in the data warehouse repository.
-   Search for artifacts within the registered applications to ensure
    the indices are all valid.
-   Run diagnostics on each server and verify the diagnostics complete
    successfully.

## Upgrade RQM

Next, generate an upgrade guide for Rational Quality Manager. Select
Quality Management, CLM 3.0.1 or any fix pack of that version, I
distribute my applications on multiple servers, Yes, I can mount shared
directories or drives, Microsoft Windows, IBM WebSphere Application
Server, IBM DB2, Yes, I have configured data warehouse in CLM 3.0.1, No
(RRDI), No (integrate with other products).

Proceed with the following steps:

-   Install CLM 40x RQM to c:\upgradews\RQM40
-   Backup the RQM WAS profile on AppSrv02
-   Backup the RQM database.
-   Uninstall the RQM application from AppSrv02
-   Update the JAZZ_HOME and log4j properties to point to the RQM40
    server installation directory. JAZZ_HOME =
    <file:///C:/UpgradeWS/IBM/RQM40/server/conf>

log4j.configuration=
<file:///C:/UpgradeWS/IBM/RQM40/server/conf/startup_log4j.properties>

-   Stop AppSrv02
-   Clean up the temp directories for AppSrv02.
    -   Delete
        C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv02\temp\\server1\jazz_war
    -   If it exists, delete
        C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv02\wscache\jazz_war
-   Clean up the logs. Make a backup copy of the existing jazz\*.log
    files. Delete the existing log file.
-   Verify the Index locations In a WAS deployment, it is important to
    pay attention to your index file locations in the 3.0.1
    teamserver.properties file, which is located in
    3.0.1_install_dir\server\conf\\ directory. There are 2 index file
    locations given in the following two properties:
    com.ibm.team.fulltext.index.location,
    com.ibm.jfs.index.root.directory. The JFS indices
    (com.ibm.jfs.index.root.directory) uses the JAZZ_HOME property if
    its value is left as the default relative path. The fulltext indices
    (com.ibm.team.fulltext.index.location), if left as the default
    relative path value, will actually be located relative to the path
    of the WAS profile hosting the application, i.e.
    C:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv02. You may have
    assumed it was relative to your local installation. In a WAS
    deployment, the fulltext index file location should always be an
    absolute path location. Both index file locations will get merged
    into your new configuration files as part of the upgrade script
    execution below. If the fulltext index location is relative, for
    example,
    com.ibm.team.fulltext.index.location=conf/jts/indices/workitemindex,
    perform this step prior to running the upgrade script. Change the
    relative path to the absolute path of the index location. In our
    workshop environment, it should be
    com.ibm.team.fulltext.index.location=c:\upgradews\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\appsrv02\conf\jazz\indices\workitemindex
    During the upgrade script execution, this will enable a copy of the

    upgraded application is brought online.
-   Run the upgrade script. This will migrate the RQM configuration
    files from 301x to 40.
    -   Cd c:\upgradews\ibm\rqm40\server
    -   Run upgrade\jazz\qm_upgrade -updateTomcatFiles no
        -newJTSHome=c:\upgradews\ibm\jts40\server\conf
        -oldApplicationHome=c:\upgradews\ibm\rqm301\server\conf
        **NOTE:** During the execution of the upgrade script, a prompt
        for review of the QM teamserver.properties will be presented. At
        this point, change the location of the index files to an
        absolute path of a stable location. A stable location is one
        that will not be deleted as part of an application uninstall for
        example. The upgrade script will perform a copy of the indices
        if there is an update during the prompt for review. For example,
        com.ibm.team.fulltext.indexLocation=QM_4.0_install_dir/server/conf/jts/indices/workitemindex
        where QM_4.0_install_dir is the location where CCM 4.0
        application is installed. **NOTE:** If the script prompts for a
        re-index or rebuildtextindices operation, this is an
        un-necessary step that has been observed intermittently in test.
        It can be safely skipped. In large repositories, this will save

-   Start the RQM application: Jazz
-   Stop and restart AppSrv02

In addition, it is recommended that you verify the following:

-   All existing registered applications are operational.
-   Run the data collection jobs and check the status for any errors.
    The data collection jobs must be run from the JTS Admin UI Reports

-   Run diagnostics on each server and verify the diagnostics complete
    successfully.

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

Here are some frequently asked questions (FAQs) and tips on some things
to do if you encounter any issues during or after the upgrade.

**What are the supported CLM 4.0.x supported upgrade paths?** See the
spreadsheet attached to [workitem
218962](https://jazz.net/jazz/web/projects/Jazz20Collaborative20ALM#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=218962)
for the information. It also covers build engine compatibility, client
compatibility, and reporting migration.

**My RRC Online migration failed. How do I recover?** If you encounter
any errors or issues with the RRC Online migration, you will need to
repeat the online migration. If so, restore the copy of the JTS database
and restart the upgrade process from that point. If you have a
distributed setup, I recommend backing up the JTS after its own upgrade
so that if RRC Online migration must be repeated you can restore to this
backup copy of the JTS. This avoids having to repeat the JTS upgrade
process.

**The RRC Online migration is not running. What could be the problem?**
In order to run RM Online migration, you must be logged in as a user
with JazzAdmins privileges and this user must be assigned a 4.0 Analyst
license. Check this on the JTS Admin UI under Users Administration and
License Key Management. Next, check the rm.log in the WAS profile logs
directory or the Tomcat logs directory.

**I started one of my applications and I cant execute an artifact
query?** You need to inspect the following property
com.ibm.team.fulltext.indexLocation in your applications
teamserver.properties file. There may be a mismatch between the location
listed there and where the server is looking for the indices. For
example, if the property still points to a relative path and you are
using WAS, you may find in the applications log file that the Fulltext
index location is pointing to a directory such as
C:\UpgradeWS\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\conf\jazz\indices\workitemindex\fulltext_index
which in fact does not contain the indices. To resolve, stop the server.
Edit the teamserver.properties file and convert the relative path to an
absolute path where the indices are actually located such as
C:\\server\conf\jazz\indices\workitemindex\fulltext_index.

**I never configured a DW for my 301x environment. What do I do now?**
You can configure a DW either before the upgrade to v4.0 or after. You
will need to run JTS setup which will walk you through the steps to
complete the DW configuration. However, please note that if you choose
to configure it after the upgrade to v4.0, do this only after all
applications in your topology (all applications that are shared by one
JTS) are upgraded to v4.0. This will ensure that the JTS setup steps are
all running against v4.0 applications.

**Can I rename my server prior to upgrading to 40?** No, server rename
is only possible with the 40 release and is only supported for staging a
test environment, not renaming a production environment. Thus, you must
upgrade to 40 prior to attempting a server rename.

**I have a distributed CLM deployment but I cannot mount drives between
the various machines. Are there special upgrade processes to follow in
that case?** We cover this case in the 4.0 interactive guide. Just
select the option for distributed deployment and that mounting drives is
not possible. Generate a guide for each of the distributed applications
you plan to upgrade. All applications with the exception of RM can be
upgraded without having to connect to the JTS machine.

**Where can I find workarounds, technotes or late-breaking updates for
the 4.0.x release?** Workaround articles will be published on Jazz.net.
A workaround article is a jazz.net article used to document a single
issue applicable to one or more GA releases. Here are some shortcuts to
help you find what you need. Note: Change the 4.0.x below to match the
latest GA release

TOC{title="Page contents"}

This page discusses common issues which are occured when running the CLM
Upgrade Scripts. When running the upgrade script files to upgrade CLM
applications, you might run into these common issues:

## CLM common upgrade questions

This section is currently in progress and will discuss running upgrade
scripts in a distributed environment.

## Known issues

Below are some common issues incurred when running the upgrade scripts
prior to step 0:

### Old Jazz Team Server version could not be determined

The Jazz Team Server upgrade script might fail with the following error:
CRJAZ2124E The old JTS version could not be determined. Verify that the
oldJTSHome is pointed at the correct installation and specify the
version using the old JTSVersion parameter. For more information on this
error navigate to [JTS Upgrade Script fails with "Old JTS version could
not be determined" error](OldJTSVersion).

### RM_upgrade.bat terminated at startup

The RM_Upgrade.bat might be terminated at startup in non-English
environments. For more information on this behavior, navigate to
[RM_Upgrade.bat is terminated in Non-English
environments](NonEnglishEnvironment).

## Additional steps in the upgrade script

AFter you have moved past step 0 of running the upgrade script, you
might incur issues at the following steps:

-   [Update configuration files (CCM, QM,
    JTS)](UpdateConfigurationFiles)
-   [Add database tables (CCM, QM, JTS)](AddDatabaseTables)
-   [Upgrade DW Schema (JTS)](UpgradeDwSchema)

## Troubleshooting

When the upgrade scripts run, each is executing a set of repotools
commands. If the scripts fail, adding in [repotools
trace](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21322003) can
help identify why the script is failing.

## Where do I go from here? If you are unable to resolve your issue using the available online resources, please open a service request with IBM Rational Support. Refer to [Additional Troubleshooting Resources](DataCollectionandSupportResources) for further details.

Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM) family of products (Rational
Team Concert, Rational Requirements Composer, and Rational Quality
Manager).

## Before upgrading

**Before you start the upgrade process, verify the integrity of the
database by runing the
[-verify](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYMRC_5.0.2/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/r_repotools_verify.html)
repotools command.**

**Planning to upgrade to version 5? See the [RRC 4.x to 5.x migration
tips and
tricks](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/RM4to5MigrationTipsTricksProblemsAndSolutions)
article for known issues**

-   Check the [Known issues](KnownIssues) for awareness of issues in the
    current version as a prerequisite for the upgrade
-   Ensure that your current environment meets all the requirements by
    checking the [Environment checklist](EnvironmentCheckList)
-   Perform the upgrade in a test environment prior to upgrading your
    production environment
-   [Backup the necessary configurations and files prior to your
    upgrade](BackupBeforeUpgrade)
-   Go through the [Upgrade
    Insider](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/UpgradeInsider)
    page of the deployment wiki for further information about your
    upgrade
-   Contact IBM Support and open up a proactive PMR with your upgrade
    plan and environment specifics. This will ensure Support is aware of
    the upgrade and can plan accordingly to become familiar with your
    environment and plan, resulting in faster response times.
-   [Update your Database Statistics](RunStatistics)

## Performing the upgrade

Below are the steps necessary to complete a successful upgrade. Each
item below discusses common issues seen at that particular step within
the upgrade process.

## Upgrade Verification

The following are some items to consider while completing a verification
of data after an upgrade:

### Admin Verification

-   Verify there are no errors in the upgrade logs
-   [Verify the configuration
    files](https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/index.jsp?re=1&topic=/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_update_prepare_config.html&scope=null)
-   [Verify server logs and
    URLs](https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/index.jsp?re=1&topic=/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_update_prepare_config.html&scope=null)
-   [Verify users, licenses and link
    artifacts](https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/index.jsp?re=1&topic=/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/c_verify_users_licenses_links.html&scope=null)
-   Verify there are no diagnostic errors on any application
-   Verify you are able to navigate between linked project areas
-   Verify there are no errors in process configuration (particularly
    for customized project areas)

Consider you or your users completing an [Upgrade
Verification](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/UpgradeVerification)
to ensure the upgrade was successful (not all steps may apply in each
environment).

Consider running an [Online
Verify](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/L3DevTool) which will check
the consistency of the data.

### User Validation:

-   Access work items, saving, creating new work items (verify no
    information is missing)
-   View plans (verify no information is missing)
-   View Dashboards; ensure all are working with no errors
-   Load Reports
-   Access Source Control (checkin, checkout, deliver)

## Issues during user verification testing after upgrade

If your upgrade was successful, but your users report the following:

-   Various functions are not working as expected, or not working the
    same as the pre-upgrade version
-   Some data, such as item statuses, are corrupted after the upgrade
-   Full text queries fail
-   Dashboard issues

Navigate to [Common issues that occur after the
upgrade](AfterTheUpgrade) for information on troubleshooting and
debugging.

## Where do I go from here? If you are unable to resolve your issue using the available online resources, open a service request with IBM Rational Support. Refer to [Additional troubleshooting resources](DataCollectionandSupportResources) for further details.

# Best Practices for ELM Usage Models [best-practices-for-elm-usage-models]

Management solution ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

Each of the ELM applications includes extensive value-added capabilities
that when used properly help customers improve their development
processes and meet their business goals. As with many applications,
there are multiple ways to accomplish the same outcome. The ELM
applications are no different in that regard. They too can be configured
in optimal and not so optimal ways.

How customers use and configure a ELM application is called a **usage
model**. This page is a collection point for gathering various usage
best practices.

# Migration guide for Rational DOORS Next Generation 6.0 [migration-guide-for-rational-doors-next-generation-6.0]

DKGRAY Authors: Main.GustafSvensson, Main.VaughnRokosz Date: May 29,
2015 Build basis: Rational Doors Next Generation (RDNG) 6.0

ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

## Introduction

This document summarizes the results of our performance testing of the
upgrade to IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG) 6.0. We look at the
time required to upgrade from RDNG 5.0.2 to 6.0 in a variety of
configurations, and identify the factors that most influence upgrade
time, including:

-   the total number of artifacts in the repository
-   the number of comments and links
-   the impact of baselines in the 5.0.x data
-   the network latency to the database server
-   using Oracle vs. DB2

We also look at how the size of the database is impacted by the upgrade.

Upgrade times in your environments may be different that what we
observed. Please be sure to review our [standard
disclaimer](#StandardDisclaimer).

## Summary of test results

### General considerations

There are two general considerations for upgrade performance:

-   Keeping the [database statistics](#DatabaseStatistics) updated
-   Adjusting the [heap size for the repotools-rm
    command](#RepotoolsHeap)

\#DatabaseStatistics

#### Database statistics

Because there are significant changes to the schema of the DNG database
for the 6.0 release, it is important to be sure that the database
statistics are kept up to date. Some of the new DNG tables will start
out empty and then grow during upgrade. This change in table size can
degrade performance of the SQL queries that are executed during upgrade
if your database is not configured to update statistics automatically.

If you update your database statistics manually, you may need to update
the statistics during the upgrade process. You can use the following
commands:

DB2 DB2 REORGCHK UPDATE STATISTICS ON TABLE ALL

Oracle EXEC DBMS_STATS.gather_schema_stats('RMSCHEMA'); (where RMSCHEMA
is the name of the RM database). \#RepotoolsHeap

#### Repotools JVM heap size

For larger repositories (\> 100K artifacts), the default heap size in
the repotools-rm command is too small. The upgrade will fail unless you
raise the heap size from the default of 1.5G to something closer to 8GB
(up to a maximum of 24G) Our tests also suggest that the 8G heap size
can improve upgrade performance by 20, for smaller repositories.

The repotools script was updated with the following line;
VMARGS="\$VMARGS -Xmx8G"

### Impact of repository size and shape

The main factor that impacts upgrade time is the total number of
artifacts of the following types: requirements, comments, and links. It
takes roughly 5 minutes per 100K artifacts to upgrade with no baselines
present. In our largest test with 4.9 million total requirements,
comments, and links, the migration time for those artifacts was 4 hours.

A secondary factor that impacts upgrade time is the number of artifacts
with comments. There is an additional upgrade step which deals with
comments. In our largest test, we migrated 1.6 million comments
associated with 551,000 artifacts and this took 71 minutes. The total
upgrade time for this configuration was 5 hours and 26 minutes.

Baselines and reviews will add additional cost. There are several
factors that determine the time it takes to migrate baselines and
reviews. The number of artifacts included in baselines and reviews do
not impact the migration time but the number of artifacts with revisions
do. Each baseline and review also adds extra processing time.

When we upgraded a repository with 2 baselines per module (where each
baseline included 10 of the module artifacts), the time to upgrade
doubled.

### Database growth during upgrade

You can expect the DNG database to grow at least 10 during the upgrade
process. The 6.0 release introduces several major new features, and
these features involve changes to the database schema. In our testing
the database size grew with 0.4GB for every 100,000 artifacts. In our
most [extreme result](#DatabaseGrowth) (with almost 5 million
artifacts), the size of the DNG database nearly doubled (from 22G to
40G). Customer data shows this ratio can vary.

### Impact of network latency to the database server

We looked at the [impact of increasing the network
latency](#LatencyImpact) between the system where we ran the upgrade to
the database server. There is a linear increase in total upgrade times
as the network latency increases, and the upgrade times double for each
additional 2 milliseconds of network latency.

For best upgrade performance, be sure that the network connection to the
database service is fast.

### Comparing Oracle and DB2

We compared the upgrade times for two systems: [one using DB2 and one
using Oracle](#DB2vsOracle). There was no significant difference in
upgrade times.

TOC{title="Page contents"}

## Introduction

This report compares the performance of an unclustered Rational Quality
Manager version 4.0.5 deployment to the previous 4.0.4 release. The test
objective is achieved in three steps:

-   Run version 4.0.4 with standard 1-hour test using 1,000 concurrent
    users.
-   Run version 4.0.5 with standard 1-hour test using 1,000 concurrent
    users.
-   The test is run three time for each version and the resulting six
    tests are compared with each other. Three tests per version is used
    to get a more accurate picture since there are variations expected
    between runs.

### Disclaimer [disclaimer]

## Findings

### Performance goals

-   Verify that there are no performance regressions between current
    release and prior release with 1,000 concurrent users using the
    workload described below.

### Findings

-   According to the testing results, the response times of the pages
    for 4.0.5 are roughly equivalent to 4.0.4 .
-   Comparing nmon data for both 4.0.5 and 4.0.4 show similar CPU,
    memory and disk utilization on application servers and database
    server.

## Methodology

Rational Performance Tester(RPT) was used to simulate the workload
created using the web client. Each user completed a random use case from
a set of available use cases. A Rational Performance Tester script is
created for each use case. The scripts are organized by pages and each
page represents a user action.

The work load is role based as each of the areas defined under sequence
of actions which are separated into individual user groups within an RPT
schedule.

#### Response time comparison

The median response time provided more even results than the average
response time. The nature of the high variance between tests where some
tasks at time takes a longer time to run, such as when the server is
under heavy load, makes the average response time less predictive. The
median values are mainly included in the following tables and charts for
comparison.

In the repository that contained 500,000 artifacts with 1,000 concurrent
users, no obvious regression was shown when comparing response times
between runs.

**Summary**

There are totally **91** pages which are under test in the performance
test. And the table below shows the summary of all the degradation pages
whose response time are longer than in 4.0.4:

TABLE{ sort="off" headerbg="#3399FF" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"
footerrows="1"}

| Degradation percent range | Count  |
|:--------------------------|:-------|
| \>=100                    | 1      |
| \>=50 and \< 100          | 3      |
| \>=20 and \< 50           | 0      |
| \>=10 and \< 20           | 12     |
| \>=0 and \< 10            | 50     |
| **Total**                 | **66** |

If we ignore the pages which response time are less than 1s and
degradation percent are less than 20, then we got the **conclusion**:

TABLE{ sort="off" headerbg="#3399FF" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" }

| Degradation percent range | Count |
|:--------------------------|:------|
| \>=20                     | 0     |

So no page performance degradation could be felt by users.

The numbers in the following charts include all of the pages for all of
the scripts that ran.

## Methodology

Rational Performance Tester(RPT) was used to simulate the workload
created using the web client. Each user completed a random use case from
a set of available use cases. A Rational Performance Tester script is
created for each use case. The scripts are organized by pages and each
page represents a user action.

The work load is role based as each of the areas defined under sequence
of actions which are separated into individual user groups within an RPT
schedule. The settings of the RPT schedule have been changed for RQM
4.0.6 performance test so that a global GC will not occur during the
staging phase. Please also refer to the QM GC map.

#### Response time comparison

The median response time provided more even results than the average
response time. The nature of the high variance between tests where some
tasks at time takes a longer time to run, such as when the server is
under heavy load, makes the average response time less predictive. The
median values are mainly included in the following tables and charts for
comparison.

In the repository that contained 500,000 artifacts with 1,000 concurrent
users, no obvious regression was shown when comparing response times
between runs.

**Summary**

There are totally **91** pages which are under test in the performance
test. And the table below shows the summary of all the degradation pages
whose response time are longer than in 4.0.5:

TABLE{ sort="off" headerbg="#3399FF" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"
footerrows="1"}

| Degradation percent range | Count  |
|:--------------------------|:-------|
| \>=100                    | 0      |
| \>=50 and \< 100          | 0      |
| \>=20 and \< 50           | 4      |
| \>=10 and \< 20           | 4      |
| \>=0 and \< 10            | 32     |
| **Total**                 | **40** |

If we ignore the pages which response time are less than 1s and
degradation percent are less than 20, then we got the **conclusion**:

TABLE{ sort="off" headerbg="#3399FF" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" }

| Degradation percent range | Count |
|:--------------------------|:------|
| \>=20                     | 0     |

So no page performance degradation could be felt by users.

The numbers in the following charts include all of the pages for all of
the scripts that ran.

**Garbage collection**

Verbose garbage collection is enable to create the GC logs. The GC logs
shows very little variation between runs. There is also no discernible
difference between versions . Below is one example of the output from
the GC log for each application.
