## Updates from [previous report](ELMLargeScaleAndPerformanceReportRelease701): 
This report provides an update to IBM Engineering Test Management (ETM) 7.0.2 performance and scalability test, from the [7.0.1 release](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/ELMLargeScaleAndPerformanceReportRelease701).

#### Datashape

In this release, the datashape has been evolved as outlined below

-   Number of components: total number of components is increased from
    11 to 2511
-   Repository size\[1\]: increased from 15 million to 20 million total
    artifacts, or by 33
-   ETM Database size on disk has grown from 775GB to 1171GB
-   Component size\[1\]:
    -   added small (\<1K), medium (5K), and large (50K) sizes
    -   keeping extra large (500K) and extra-extra-large (10M) sizes

\[1\]: measured by total number of versioned artifacts generated by the
[Data Generation Tool](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/RQMDatagen)
which collects the sum from each artifact type visible in the UI.

The size and number of different components are summarized in the table
below TABLE{ sort="off" headerbg="#3399FF" cellpadding="2"
cellspacing="2" dataalign="center" caption="versioned test artifact

#### Configuration test coverage

The performance and load tests of small, medium, and large sized
components are evaluated under Global Configuration (GC) for this
release. The GC component is consisted of all 2500 ETM components. The
extra and extra-extra large sized components remain to be tested against
their local ETM configurations including both streams and baselines for
regression purpose.

#### Disclaimer

The extra-extra-large sized component was created initially to expediate
the growth of the repository without consideration of artifact versions
(i.e. the artifacts were generated in an opt-out environment prior to
the enablement of Configuration Management feature). The test against
this particular component was initially experimental during 7.0, but it
continuously serves as a way to regression test the performance of IBM
IBM Engineering Test Management (ETM). The results using this component
can represent edge cases due to its huge size, thus the measurement for
the performance of this component shown in the report should be looked
at and analyzed as a comparison of the performance of different releases
in the context of datashape. It should not be deemed as a performance
benchmark.

## Summary of regression test results

We continue to find the following performance characteristics as we keep
increasing the size of the repository

#### Component performance vs. component size For any given repository size, generally:

-   The smaller a component, the faster page response times or better
    performance for that component. Under the 20 million repository, for
    components that have a size ranged from small to large, 98 of the
    individual page response times are under 2 seconds (with the
    exception of Dashboard loading being 4 seconds, and Saving a test
    plan may take 5 seconds due to large amount of iterations defined);
    whereas 11 out of 120 pages are exceeding 5 seconds for the
    extra-large component, most of these slower pages are
    browsing/searching a given artifact type that has a larger total
    count, including searching/filtering test case results (9 seconds)
    and test case records (5.5 seconds) in the default views within a
    stream.

The detailed analysis of the component performance as a function of
component size can be found in [ETM 7.0.1 Performance
Report](ELMLargeScaleAndPerformanceReportRelease701). Its worthy to note
that since the component size can vary substantially, each of the
individual test load was only focused on homogeneously sized components.
Carrying out test loads this way not only leads to statistically
normalization of page response times, but also allows servers to warmup
thoroughly and database become more optimal.

#### Component performance vs. growing repository size

-   The general performance of a given component\[2\] degrades as the
    repository size grows. Although the measurements based on
    extre-extra-large sized component stress tested some edge cases, we
    observed a projection of a slight degradation when comparing between
    the 15-million repository and the 10-million repository, yet a minor
    to moderate degradation in comparing the 20-million repository to
    the 15-million repository. The degradation degree for 500K component
    is still minor under 20-million repository (average page response
    time for all pages degraded by less than 10, comparing to 15-million
    repository).
-   Within a component context, the pages that are more sensitive to the
    size of the entire repository include those embracing the largest
    test artifact counts, for instances, in our test environment, page
    Browse Test Case Execution Records (total count of 4 million in a
    single component, or 30 of total artifact count in the repository),
    Browse Test Case Results, and the relevant pages to search/filter
    the test artifact.

For a detailed analysis of the component performance as a function of
repository size, please refer to [ETM 7.0.1 Performance
Report](ELMLargeScaleAndPerformanceReportRelease701).

\[2\]: component size did not grow prior to the performance load test.

## Whats not in scope of test for this release

Like all previous releases, scalability that may be impacted by any of
the following dimensions are not covered in 7.0.2 tests -

-   The growth of number of baselines for a given component or stream
-   The growth of number of versions for a given configuration
-   The growth of number of states for a given artifact
